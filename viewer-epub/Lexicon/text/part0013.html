			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Emily kept waiting for someone to pull her aside, ask what she thought she was doing, trying to sneak on board with the first-class passengers. But when she reached the gate and handed over her boarding pass, the attendant smiled. “Have a nice flight, Ms. Ruff.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thanks.” She adjusted the strap of her bag, self-conscious. The other first-class passengers were in sleek suits and expensive blouses, and Emily was wearing jeans a guy had peed on the day before. She hadn’t realized everyone would be so bright and clean.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ms. Ruff!” said the attendant on the plane, like he’d been waiting to meet her. “My information tells me this is the first time you’ve graced our airline. That cannot be true.” He beckoned, leading her past banks of leather thrones. “I am going to take extra special care of you.” He leaned close and whispered, stage-loud, “We need more beautiful young customers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She thought he was making fun. But he wasn’t. First class was strange.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Make yourself comfortable,” said the attendant, “while I rustle you up the best chocolate cookie you’ve ever tasted.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” she said. She went to stow her bag and the attendant looked horrified and took it from her. She slid into her seat. She had slept in smaller places than this. To her right, a woman in big sunglasses had a tall glass in one hand and a magazine in the other. She smiled at Emily, and Emily smiled back. The woman returned to her magazine. This was okay, she thought. This was okay.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She heard a tinkling and reached for her bag. The flight attendant whispered, “I’m so sorry.” He set a glass of water onto the armrest. The tinkling was ice cubes. “I didn’t mean to wake you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stared at the glass. When she’d first heard that sound, she’d thought someone was peeing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She deplaned. That was what they called it: <em class="calibre1">deplaning</em>. She had never heard that word before. She unbuckled and felt sad. She wanted to stay in her little first-class kingdom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She’d left a note for a friend to pass to Benny. Had he read it yet? Was he upset? Missing her? She didn’t care about this as much as she’d thought. She had realized this while gazing out at the hidden world of sunlight that lay above the clouds: She was leaving Benny behind. And this was a good thing. She felt like she had two years before, when she’d walked away from a falling-down house with her Pikachu bag on her back, her mom’s threats and prophecies bouncing off her back, and the more she walked the better she felt. Benny hadn’t been good. Not really. She was getting a sense of that, now that people were taking her bags and bringing her drinks while she slept. She was seeing that without Benny, she could be so much more.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The attendant touched her arm at the exit. “Thank you so much.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thank <em class="calibre1">you</em> so much,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">In Arrivals stood a driver, complete with hat and uniform, holding a printed sign reading <span class="SCAP1">EMILY RUFF</span>. “I’m Emily,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He reached for her bag. She hesitated, but let him take it; she needed to get used to that. “I’m very pleased to meet you, miss. I have a car out front. Was your flight bearable?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” She fell into step. She felt kind of stupid about the Pokémon bag. It looked ridiculous on this guy’s trolley. But he didn’t seem to mind. People glanced at her, this dirty girl with a uniformed driver, and she tried not to smile, so as not to ruin it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He held open a door for her. Outside was bright and cold. A long, liquid black limousine lay spread along the curb. The driver opened the rear door and she climbed inside like it was nothing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Did she want a drink? To watch TV? Because she could do that. There was enough room to lie down. She could live here.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The driver entered. The locks thunked. “No rain expected. You come to us on a good day.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I thought it was a good day,” she said. “I felt that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They drove for forty minutes and stopped at a set of high steel gates. Through the limo’s dark glass, she saw grass and gigantic trees. The driver spoke to someone in a guardhouse; the gates parted. As they moved up the hill, a building appeared.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s an old convent,” said the driver. “There were nuns here for a hundred years.” The car pulled around the front of the building, its tires crunching gravel. A man came down steps toward them. A porter. That was what he was. “Beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’ll take you from here.” He turned in his seat to face her. She liked that: the way people were turning to talk to her. “Best of luck with your examinations, miss.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The porter led her to a room with high ceilings and wood-paneled walls and ten thousand books. A sitting room, she guessed. Because she had heard of those, and couldn’t think what else this room was for. Maybe nothing. Maybe after a certain size, a building had more rooms than uses. She squeezed her bag between her ankles and tried to relax. Occasionally she heard a door close—<em class="calibre1">thonk</em>—and murmurs of conversation, and laughter that floated up a corridor somewhere. She kind of needed to pee.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A woman’s heels rapped outside. The door clacked open. For a second, Emily thought it was a nun, but it was just a woman in a dark blue suit. She had nuns on the brain. The woman was slim, maybe thirty-five, with dark hair and delicate glasses. She came toward Emily with her hand extended and her fingers down. A lady handshake. Emily got off the chair to take it. “Hello, Emily. Thank you so much for joining us. I’m Charlotte.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hi,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte settled into a chair. Emily returned to hers. They seemed a long way apart. A rug lay between them like a map of some undiscovered world. “In a moment, I’ll show you to your room,” Charlotte said. “But first, I’m sure you must have questions.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She did. Like, <em class="calibre1">What was with that Lee guy</em>, and <em class="calibre1">Why me</em>, and <em class="calibre1">These examinations, what are they, exactly</em>. But she didn’t ask them. The thing was, if these questions had bad answers, it was going to be really disappointing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have six of you this week,” said Charlotte, deciding to answer questions Emily hadn’t asked. “Six applicants, that is. You each have your own room, of course. Yours overlooks the East Wood; I think you’ll enjoy it. There’s a central dining room, where you’ll be served meals, and you’ll find a recreation room at the end of the hall, and a reading room beside that. Between examinations, please do feel free to explore the grounds. It’s a wonderful space. It was once a convent.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I heard.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If you leave the New Wing, you may bump into some of our current students going about their lessons. They are under instruction not to speak to you, so please don’t interpret this as rudeness.” She smiled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I must ask that you observe two rules for the duration of the examinations. You are not to leave the grounds, nor use the phones. These rules are quite important. Do you find them acceptable?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Good!” She patted her lap, like she wanted a cat to sit there. “Well, then. For the rest of the day, you may simply settle in. Meet your fellow applicants, enjoy the facilities. The examinations will begin in the morning.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I do have a question,” Emily said. “What’s the catch?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte’s eyebrows rose. She had good eyebrows. Like whips. “I beg your pardon?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well . . .” She gestured at the room. “This is kind of unbelievably good. I mean, I appreciate it, but if you’re going to ask me to shave my head or take my clothes off or something, I’d like to know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte suppressed a smile. “We’re not a cult, I promise. We’re a school. We bring the best and the brightest here to help them reach their potential.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right,” Emily said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You seem unconvinced.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It doesn’t look like a school.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Actually, it looks very much like a school. You may think otherwise because your experience has been limited to government-run child farms.” She leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, “To me, those do not look very much like schools.” Emily wasn’t sure how to respond. Charlotte rose to her feet. “Well! Let me show you your room.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She picked up her bag. “I still think there’s a catch.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte pursed her lips. “If there must be a catch, we do only admit those who pass the examinations. Which are difficult.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll pass.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte smiled. “Well, then,” she said. “There’s no catch.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She followed Charlotte through wood-paneled corridors and halls with far-off ceilings. She had never seen so many arches. Charlotte tapped a door with her fingernail. “My office.” A copper nameplate was engraved <span class="SCAP1">C. BRONTË</span>. “Come to me with any questions or concerns, day or night.” There were more corridors. Through tall, slitted windows, she glimpsed kids in dark blue uniforms with hats and blazers. Maybe it did look like a school.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte stopped outside a heavy wooden door. “Your room.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was a small bed. A high, arched window. One old desk with a high-backed chair. The walls were stone, patches worn smooth by the palms of restless nuns.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A few of the others are about,” said Charlotte. “But I’ll let you find them in your own time.” She smiled, one hand draped on the door handle. “Dinner will be called at six.” The door closed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily let her bag drop. She went to the window and studied the mechanism until she figured out how to swing open the glass in two panels. She leaned out. A breeze tugged her hair. <em class="calibre1">Woods</em> was right. The trees were like pillars. You could get lost in there. Find a gingerbread house. Meet a witch.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She needed the bathroom. She would have to find some of the other kids, check out the competition. But she stood awhile and watched the trees, because even if this whole deal turned out to be a scam, this moment here was really nice.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She peed and washed her hands and studied herself in the mirror. Her hair was like straw. She was wearing an outfit that looked worse the fancier her environment became and didn’t smell terrific, either. But aside from this, she did not seem completely out of place. She could possibly believe she was a person who regularly peed in bathrooms with twenty-foot ceilings. And then went out on her horse. “Relax,” she told the mirror, because her eyes were tense.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She followed sounds of a television to a small room with sofas and cushions and a boy spread across them. He sat up as she entered. His hair was very curly. His clothes were new and bright and his collar was turned up. If they had something in common, she couldn’t see it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyes moved over her. He was probably thinking the same thing. “Hey,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hi. Who are you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A guy. On a sofa.” He smiled. She hated him already. “You’re here for the tests?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just arrived?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“From where?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“San Francisco.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right,” he said. “And, uh, where in San Francisco?” He smiled again. That upturned collar, what was that?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Street.” He looked blank. “The,” she said. “The street. You know. The street.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He shook his head. “I don’t know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah, I see that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry. I don’t mean to offend. I mean, what is it you, uh, do?” He twirled a finger, indicating the room. “They don’t bring you here for no reason.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m a magician. I entertain.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Really?” he said. “You don’t strike me as the entertaining type.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You don’t strike me as someone who knows jack about shit,” she said, because she was starting to get a little intimidated by his wording. “Why are you here?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He grinned. His teeth were really something. “New England Schools Debating Conference. Finals.” He waited for a response. “I’m good.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She showered and re-dressed. Where she’d come from, it was fine to wear the same clothes for days at a time; that meant you were busy following life’s opportunities. But she could see that here it was going to become an issue. She pulled on her jacket, at least, which was furry and had little biker studs she made fun of if anyone mentioned them but secretly thought were awesome. She brushed her hair until most of the knots were gone and clipped it out of her face. She had a faint memory of mascara left in her makeup bag and scraped together what she could to give herself smoky eyes. She had lost her deodorant somewhere. But she had soaped up in the shower. The reality was she smelled better than she had in a while.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A bell rang somewhere: an honest to God bell, like a musical instrument. She opened her door to faces peering out of doorways. They were all young, mostly female. “Chow time!” said a black girl across the hall, and there were titters.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The dining hall table had twelve places set on a tablecloth the size of a bedsheet but there were still miles of glowing wood stretching away at either end. The curly-haired boy came in, joking with a girl she hadn’t met, and sat opposite. She thought he might look at her but he didn’t. She tried to figure out the cutlery. A girl, no more than ten, climbed onto a chair beside her. Emily said hi and the girl said hi back, shyly. On her other side, a pretty girl with angel-blond hair slid into a seat. The curly-haired boy looked at the blond girl and away and then back and Emily thought, <em class="calibre1">Yeah, okay</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte, whom Emily still vaguely thought of as a nun, moved around the table, chatting briefly to each of them. Bread was served. Soup. The ten-year-old stared hopelessly at her spoons and Emily tried to help with educated guesses based on what everyone else was using.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I love your jacket,” said the angelic blond girl. “It’s so authentic.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” she said. “I like your ears.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“My ears?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily had meant that as an insult but now realized the angel girl was serious. The girl had seriously tried to compliment her jacket. “Yeah. They’re like a fairy’s.” She elbowed the ten-year-old. “Fairy ears, right?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” said the angel girl. “Well, thank you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There were silver plates with bite-size constructions of meat and bread and paste and whatever. She picked one up only because it got her out of this conversation. It was actually not bad. Weird, but not bad-weird. This was her whole day, on a cracker.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte rose and gave a short speech about how happy she was to have them here and she hoped they would seize the opportunity with two hands because each of them had great potential and the Academy was dedicated to unlocking it. Then she said they should sleep well because the first examination would begin early, and the curly-haired boy asked what it would be, and Charlotte smiled and said that would be answered by the morning. Those were her words: <em class="calibre1">Answered by the morning.</em> You would get your head kicked in talking that way in Emily’s world, but she was kind of enjoying it. On the pier, under her floppy hat, she used words to make people smile and come closer and give her two dollars and not care about losing. Good words were the difference between Emily eating well and not. And what she had found worked best were not facts or arguments but words that tickled people’s brains for some reason, that just amused them. Puns, and exaggerations, and things that were true and not at the same time. <em class="calibre1">Answered by the morning.</em> Words like that.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Afterward, they filed back to their rooms and she brushed her teeth alongside a girl from Connecticut. Everyone but her had pajamas. On her way to bed, a voice floated down the hallway: “Good night, girl in a doorway.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Night, boy on a sofa,” she said. She closed her door. She couldn’t believe she had just said that. He was trouble, this boy. But the good kind.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">In the morning, they were sat in a hall and given forms. The first questions she recognized: Was she a cat person or a dog person? What was her favorite color? Did she love her family? Even the weird one was right there: <em class="calibre1">Why did you do it?</em> It was at the very top of a page and the rest was nothing but endless lines.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Please answer with complete honesty,” said Charlotte. She moved between their desks, echoes of her heels bouncing between the floor and ceiling. “Anything less will not serve you well.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They asked her favorite movies. Songs. Books. She hadn’t read a book since she was eight. She glanced around. The ten-year-old was three desks behind. Her feet didn’t even reach the floor. Emily twirled her pen. She wrote: <em class="calibre1">Princess Lily Saves the World</em>. It was the only one she could remember.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte collected the papers and disappeared for a while. People leaned across aisles and compared answers. She noticed a man in the corridor, tall with brown skin and eyes like rocks, watching them through the glass. She felt flustered for some reason and looked away, and when she looked back, he was gone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte returned with a TV on a trolley. “You will be shown a series of rapidly changing images. One of the images will be of a type of food. You are to write down the name of the food. Are there any questions?” She looked around. “Very well. Good luck.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily picked up her pencil. Charlotte pressed a button on the VCR. On the screen, text appeared—SERIES 1-1—then faded away. There was a second of blackness. Then a jumble of images flashed by and was gone. Emily blinked. The screen said: END OF SERIES 1-1. Heads bent over desks. Emily looked at her paper. That had been a lot faster than she’d expected. What had she seen? A laughing face. A family around a table. People kissing. Grass. A cow. A glass of milk? She wasn’t sure. Which was strange, because she was observant. She had quick eyes. So why wasn’t she sure about the milk? She glanced around. Everyone but her was writing. She chewed her lip. She wrote: MILK.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Pens down, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She glanced around. The curly-haired boy to her right had SUSHI. She felt cold. Had there been sushi? Maybe. She looked left. The angel girl: SUSHI.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte prowled the desks. “Yes,” she said, passing a boy at the front. “Yes. Yes.” She stopped at Emily. “No.” Emily exhaled. “Yes. Yes. No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She turned to see who else had fucked up. It was the ten-year-old, who looked devastated. Before she hid her paper, Emily saw: MILK.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Series two,” said Charlotte.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Obviously, what she’d done wrong was let herself be misled by the other images. Breakfast, a cow, and there <em class="calibre1">had</em> been a glass, but empty. Her brain had filled that in. She was too imaginative. And the reason she didn’t get sushi was she didn’t know what the fuck sushi looked like. She kind of remembered now. But it wasn’t exactly a familiar food. These other guys probably ate sushi twice a week, with caviar and quail and whatever that paste was on the crackers yesterday. <a id="Anchor-2"></a>Pâté. That. She would get the next one.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Images flickered. The screen blanked. Terror gripped her. There had been a banana. Definitely a banana. But also a sun, which kind of looked like a banana, and at the start she’d caught a glimpse of what might have been a fish. She had definitely seen palm trees and an ocean. She wasn’t sure about the fish. Or the banana. The banana could have been an afterimage of the sun. Why were there palm trees? Was that random, or was it trying to make her think of fish? She squeezed her pen. She wrote: FISH.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Answers, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She looked around. The curly-haired boy: BANANA. The angel girl: BANANA. The ten-year-old: FISH.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. Yes. Yes.” Charlotte reached her. “No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She had outsmarted herself. She should have trusted her instincts. She didn’t want to meet the curly-haired boy’s eyes but couldn’t stop herself. His eyes were closed, as if he was focusing, clearing his mind. <em class="calibre1">Dick</em>, she thought. But maybe she should do that.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Series three.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The screen barfed images. This time it talked, which took her by surprise: A man said, “Red,” and an old woman laughed, and was that a strawberry? No, a blood spot. It ended. She had definitely seen ice cream in a cone. She wrote that down before she could second-guess herself. She covered her paper with her hands and stared holes in the girl in front of her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The curly-haired boy put down his pen. She couldn’t see his paper, so she mouthed: <em class="calibre1">Ice cream?</em> His eyebrows rose. She didn’t know what that meant. She felt a surging desire to pick up her pen and write something else. But she hadn’t seen anything but ice cream.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Answers, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The curly-haired boy moved his hands. STRAWBERRY. “Double <em class="calibre1">fuck</em>,” she said. She didn’t bother to look at the others. Charlotte reached her and confirmed that she had gotten it wrong, again. There were two more nos: Along with her and the ten-year-old, a skinny guy in the back had messed up. Emily was glad for this, but mostly furious. Give ten dollars to each of the people in this room, wait two hours, and Emily would have it all. Drop them on the street with no cash and no place to sleep, she would be the one with her shit together twenty-four hours later. These tests, though, were making her feel like a moron.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Series four.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Fuck you</em>, she thought. She looked at the screen but her heart wasn’t in it. It was the longest sequence yet. When it ended, she looked at her paper and thought: <em class="calibre1">I have no idea.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The girl in front of her let out an explosive sneeze. It was the kind of thing Benny would do when she wanted a moment’s distraction, and without thinking, she flicked her eyes right. Beneath the curly-haired boy’s arm: APR. The rest was obscured. “Bless you,” said the angel. Someone tittered. “Quiet,” said Charlotte.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She couldn’t think of a food that started with APR. She was mentally stuck on APPLE. Could he have written APP? If she couldn’t think of an APR food in five seconds, she was going with APPLE. Charlotte opened her mouth. Emily scrawled: APRICOT.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Answers, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She glanced right. <em class="calibre1">Yes.</em> Charlotte began to walk the desks. “Yes. Yes. Yes.” By the time she reached Emily, Emily had noticed a problem. The boy had APRICOTS. She was short an S. Charlotte paused. Emily said nothing. <em class="calibre1">Come on</em>, she thought. <em class="calibre1">Apricot, apricots, what’s the difference?</em> “Yes,” said Charlotte.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She glowed. This was what she should have done from the beginning. This was how she’d accomplished everything in her whole life: by skirting the rules. She should not have forgotten that.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. Yes. No.” Charlotte walked to the front and turned off the TV. “Thank you. This concludes the first examination. Please enjoy the rest of the day.” People began to talk, rising from their desks. “Gertie, remain behind, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily looked at the ten-year-old. The kid looked miserable, so Emily leaned over. “It’s just a stupid test.” She’d been wrong about this girl’s age. Gertie wasn’t even ten. “Don’t worry about it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Emily Ruff,” said Charlotte. “You may go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re just too young,” Emily said. “I was here a couple years back and failed everything. Next year, you’ll smash it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Gertie looked at her hopefully.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Thank</em> you, Emily,” said Charlotte.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She gave Gertie a wink on the way out, the kind that tickled people on the pier.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">“Thought you were history,” said the curly-haired boy. She had been passing by his room but now she stopped. He was splayed on his bed. The angel girl was in there, leaning against the stone wall.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just warming up.” She went to move on, but the girl peeled herself from the wall.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hey. I want your opinion. Why do the teachers here have fake names?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily looked at her, confused.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Charlotte Brontë. There’s a teacher named Robert Lowell and a Paul Auster, too. Did you see the main board in the lobby? It says before Brontë, the headmistress was Margaret Atwood.” She raised her eyebrows.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And . . . ?” said Emily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re famous poets,” said the boy. “Dead famous poets, mostly.” He looked at the angel girl, amused. “She didn’t know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Like I sit around memorizing <em class="calibre1">poets</em>,” Emily said. “This is why I’m going to destroy you in the tests, because everything you know is useless.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The boy grinned. The girl said, “It’s okay,” in a tone that made Emily want to hit her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And the school has no name. They just call it the Academy. Kind of weird, yes?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re kind of weird,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Gertie didn’t come back. “The tests are eliminations,” said the curly-haired boy, through a mouthful of rye bread. This was at lunch. He had taken Gertie’s seat. “Fail one, that’s it. Pack your bags.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She paused midway through buttering a roll. “Who told you that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No one. I figured it out. It’s obvious, don’t you think?” He chewed and chewed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Charlotte came in during lunch and looked at Emily in a way Emily didn’t like. Then she left. Emily continued eating, but her stomach formed a hard ball. Afterward, Charlotte and another teacher were waiting for her in the corridor. It reminded Emily of San Francisco, where you’d step in the front door of your squat and there’d be two skinny bitches there, hips jutting, lips like cats’ asses, trembling with righteous outrage about something or other. Some debt, or thing you did. Charlotte beckoned. “Emily. If you please.” Her heels clacked down the hall.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In her office, Charlotte gestured at a chair. The office was larger than Emily had thought. It had doors to other rooms, one of which Charlotte must sleep in, since she’d said to come see her any time of day. It had a single window that looked onto a courtyard, and a messy desk, on which stood a vase of fresh flowers. “I’m disappointed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We gave you a sizable opportunity. You will never know how great.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The examination room is monitored. Carefully.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I see,” Emily said. There was silence. “So you’re saying I did something wrong in some way.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Cheating? Yes. That was wrong.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, you should have said that. You should have said, ‘Actually, we have three rules, the third one is don’t cheat.’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You think that bears stating?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That guy in San Francisco who sent me here, Lee, he knew I cheated people. That’s what I do. I’m a hustler. You bring me here but suddenly I can’t cheat? You never said that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I said honest answers were essential.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“In the test <em class="calibre1">before</em>. Not the video test.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This isn’t up for discussion,” Charlotte said. “A driver is coming to collect you. Please collect your things.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” she said, “fuck.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You may have been promised compensation for your time here. Unfortunately, that will not apply, due to the cheating.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You bitch.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte’s face didn’t change. Emily had expected some kind of reaction, from someone so nunnish. She had assumed Charlotte was quietly furious, the way people got when you broke one of their made-up rules, but the truth was Charlotte didn’t seem to care. “You may go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Forget the driver. I don’t want anything from you.” She got up.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The airport is twenty miles. The driver—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck your driver,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She went to her room and stuffed clothes into her Pikachu bag. Until this point she had felt nothing but anger, but abruptly she was heartbroken and shaky with tears. She threw the bag over her shoulder and banged into the corridor. “Hey!” It was the curly-haired boy. “What happened? Where are you going?” But she didn’t answer and he didn’t come after her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was no sign of a driver and she began to trudge down the driveway. About a thousand windows looked onto her back, and she imagined eyes in each one. But that was silly; the fact was, nobody would care. She would be gone five minutes and they would forget she’d existed, because the place made more sense without her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Halfway down the driveway, a car crunched up behind her. “Emily Ruff?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t want a driver.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not . . .” She heard the hand brake crank, the door open. “I’m not a driver.” It was the tall man she’d seen through the glass during her test. “My name is Eliot. Please come back to the house.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ve been evicted.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hold up a second. Stop.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stopped. The man scrutinized her. He had a stillness about him, which made him hard to read.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You cheated. Your defense is that nobody said you couldn’t. I agree. Go back to the house.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t want to go back to the house.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why not?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Because I’m not going to make it, okay? It’s pretty clear that everyone here but me is incredibly smart and knows, like, the names of poets, so . . . thanks for the opportunity.” She started walking again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He matched her pace. “There are two types of exams. The first tests your ability to withstand persuasion. The second measures your ability to persuade. This is more important. And from what I’ve seen, you have a good shot at those.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Charlotte said—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s not up to Charlotte.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She looked back at the school. It was kind of tempting.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It would be a shame to never discover what you were capable of.” He shrugged. “My opinion.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, fine,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She returned to her room and dumped her bag. She didn’t think she’d have to wait long and she was right. The curly-haired boy came in and looked at her angrily. “I thought you left.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I changed my mind.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Or someone changed it for you?” He folded his arms. “They only take one of us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The angel girl appeared in the doorway. Emily said, “They only take one?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I never heard that,” said the angel girl.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“On the last day, if there’s more than one candidate left, you have to persuade the others to quit. That’s how you make it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I never heard that,” said the girl, “and I say, welcome back, Emily.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re an idiot,” said the boy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re an asshole,” said the girl.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The boy looked at her. “You might as well leave now. I bet you’re persuasive as hell, to people who know your parents. In student council, you’re a queen. But you’re only here because it’s supposed to be the best, and that’s what good little girls do. They do their best.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The girl’s cheeks flamed. “Is this supposed to make me quit?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I already know how to make you quit. Have Daddy call and say he misses you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The girl turned and left. Emily heard her feet slapping down the corridor. She looked at the boy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This school is mine,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Early next morning, Charlotte drove her downtown. She barely spoke and Emily was still somewhat pissed so it was a quiet journey. They pulled into a parking garage and Charlotte killed the engine. Emily unbuckled but Charlotte didn’t move.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot thinks you’re worth persisting with,” Charlotte said to the rearview mirror. “It seems pointless to me. But occasionally he sees things.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily kept her mouth shut.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Usually, this examination is administered by a junior staff member.” Charlotte popped open the glove box and applied big sunglasses. They made her look elegant and sexy, not like a nun at all. “But since you are so allegedly bursting with potential, I wanted to see for myself.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She led Emily to a nondescript street corner, where there was a grocer, a newspaper stand, and a dog tied to a <span class="SCAP1">NO STANDING </span>pole. One of those things was important, Emily figured. Charlotte glanced at her watch. It was early but the sun was peeking above the buildings and seemed excited to be there. If they were going to hang around out here, Emily should lose the jacket.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Our purpose today is to test your lexicon,” Charlotte said. “By which I mean your array of useful words.” This did not clarify anything for Emily. “Are you ready?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte’s sunglasses swung to the far sidewalk, which was empty. They waited. “A whore is ‘one who desires.’ The word is Proto-Indo-European. From the same root as <em class="calibre1">love</em>. Did you know that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Today, the word is used to describe any person who can be persuaded. Most obviously, by money for sex. But also more generally. One may ‘whore oneself’ by performing any kind of vaguely unpleasant act in exchange for reward.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily shifted from one foot to the other.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A similar term is <em class="calibre1">proselyte</em>. Typically used in a religious sense, to denote a person converting from one faith to another. Like a whore, a proselyte is persuaded to perform an act. The difference is that a whore does what she knows is wrong for reward, while a proselyte does what she has been persuaded to believe is right.” She glanced at Emily. “You are to remain within three feet of where you currently stand. If you move beyond that radius, you fail the examination. You are to persuade people on that side of the road to cross to this side. You may not use the same method of persuasion more than once per person or group. Each person or group you fail to persuade is a strike. After three strikes, the test ends. You begin now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily stared. Charlotte nodded to the far sidewalk. A girl in a track suit was jogging down it. For a moment, Emily froze. Then she yelled, “Hey! Hello!” She waved her arms. The jogger pulled earbuds out of her ears. “Can you come here? Please? It’s very important!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The woman looked annoyed. But she stopped, checked the traffic, and headed across the road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Nonspecific anonymous verbal summons,” said Charlotte, retreating to the shade of a clothes store awning. “One.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The jogger reached her, blond and sweaty. “Yeah?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sorry,” said Emily. “I thought you were somebody else.” The woman gave her a dirty look and plugged her earbuds back in. Emily felt sweat on the back of her neck. “How many do I need to pass?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m afraid I can’t divulge that. But if you’re interested, the record is thirty-six.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jesus.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot, actually. Attention, please. Here comes another.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily pulled off her jacket and dropped it to the sidewalk. “John!” she yelled. “John! <em class="calibre1">Hey, John!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The man on the opposite sidewalk paused. When he realized she was talking to him, he looked amused and shook his head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?” She held her hand behind her ear. “Can’t hear you, John!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not John!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">What?</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not . . .” He gave up and detoured toward her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Verbal summons by name,” said Charlotte. “Two.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Three women climbed out of a car, talking and laughing. “Hey! Free outfits!” Emily said. “First three customers!” Their heads turned. Emily pointed at the clothes store. “Up to two hundred dollars per customer!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Verbal promise of material reward by proxy. Three.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The man reached her, smiling gently. “I think you’ve confused me with somebody else.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, yeah.” Over his shoulder, a mother holding the hand of a young boy headed for the grocer. “Sorry about that. Ma’am! Ma’am! I need to talk to you about your son!” The woman glanced at her, then away. “Ma’am, there is something wrong with your son!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Did you say free outfits?” one of the trio asked her. She had a stud in her nose and outrageous mascara.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ma’am!” Emily yelled at the mother. “There is a real serious problem with your son! I’m not joking!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The mother turned in to the grocer. Emily could read tension in her neck: She’d heard but chosen to ignore her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She looked at Charlotte. “That’s only one strike, right, because they were together.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Correct. One strike.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t see any signs,” said the mascara woman. “Do we just go in, or . . . ?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah. Go in.” The middle-aged man was leaving, looking disappointed. She guessed he wanted to be John. But coming down the far sidewalk was a gaggle of college-age boys in baggy pants and muscle shirts. She opened her mouth, almost reused a method, then dropped to one knee. “Ow! Shit! Ow!” The boys’ heads turned. She pretended to try to rise. “Shit! Help!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">At eight-thirty, she removed her T-shirt. Beneath it she had a plain bra; she hesitated, then unhooked it. Her skin puckered. She waved to a group of boys gaping across the street. They looked at each other, laughed, and came within two feet of being cleaned up by a sedan on their way over. Emily glanced at Charlotte. “This is allowed, right?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Nonverbal sexual invitation. Nineteen.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She thought she heard a tone. “Are you disappointed?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Actually,” said Charlotte, “I’m surprised you waited this long.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Check it,” snickered one of the boys. They clustered ten feet away, at the edge of the street, as if afraid to come any closer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hey,” she said, “do me a favor. Go to that corner and don’t let anyone past you. Make everyone come over here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What for?” said one. Another said, “I want to stay and look at your titties.” This cracked them up for a while. They were pretty young.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll make it worth your while.” There was a man coming: a big guy, with a shaved head and a black undershirt. “Real nice! Personal!” She didn’t know what she was saying.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The boys headed across the street. She pulled her T-shirt back on, to avoid breaking the rule about reusing a technique. Charlotte said, “I hope you’re aware that should your proxies redirect multiple groups, that will count as a duplicate method of persuasion, and therefore a strike.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh. Shit.” The boys were talking animatedly to the shaved head man, pointing at her. Behind them, a small group of elderly women approached. “Shit!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Twenty,” said Charlotte, as the man with the shaved head crossed the street. “Persuasion by proxy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s enough!” she yelled at the boys. “Go away now!” But they were focused on the old women. “You . . . dicks!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The man with the shaved head reached her. His face was guarded; she had no idea what the boys had told him. Her bra was lying on the concrete, she noticed. She had forgotten it. “You okay?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They attacked me.” She picked up her bra and clutched it to her chest. “Those boys.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">While the man with the shaved head was beating up the boys, she got her bra back on. She pulled her hair free of the back of her T-shirt. The old women had backed up to the far corner and were waiting for the lights to cross. The sidewalk was otherwise empty. She had a minute. Charlotte said, “Diversion by physical threat. Twenty-one.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh my God!” she yelled, because a pair of middle-aged women were coming now. “It’s Demi Moore!” The women stopped. Emily pointed at Charlotte. “Can I have your autograph?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte’s lips twitched.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There is a similarity,” Emily said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Attraction by . . . feigned celebrity, I suppose. Twenty-two.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s a pass, again?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Charlotte’s sunglasses regarded her. “Five.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Five,” Emily echoed. She felt good. A teenage girl in big headphones rounded the corner, heading down the sidewalk. Emily had no idea what she was going to say to the little whore, but it was something. She opened her mouth.</p>
