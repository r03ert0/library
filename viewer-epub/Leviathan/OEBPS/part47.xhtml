      <h2>â€œMiller,â€� the detective replied. â€œYes. Firstâ€”and...</h2>
      <p>â€œAnd,â€� Holden said, â€œwe think we can track down where their observation station is.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred leaned back in his chair, the fake leather and metal frame creaking under his weight even in the one-third g.</p>
      <p>â€œStop them how?â€� he asked. Fred knew. He just wanted to hear them say it out loud. Miller played along.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™d say we fly to their station and shoot them.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWho is â€˜weâ€™?â€� Fred asked.</p>
      <p>â€œThere are a lot of OPA hotheads looking to shoot it out with Earth and Mars,â€� Holden said. â€œWe give them some real bad guys to shoot at instead.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred nodded in a way that didnâ€™t mean he agreed y tha K agto anything.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd your sample? The captainâ€™s safe?â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s mine,â€� Holden said. â€œNo negotiation on that.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred laughed again, though there was some humor in it this time. Miller blinked in surprise and then stifled a grin.</p>
      <p>â€œWhy would I agree to that?â€� Fred asked.</p>
      <p>Holden lifted his chin and smiled.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat if I told you that Iâ€™ve hidden the safe on a planetesimal booby-trapped with enough plutonium to break anyone who touches it into their component atoms even if they could find it?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Fred stared at him for a moment, then said, â€œBut you didnâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWell, no,â€� Holden said. â€œBut I could tell you I did.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou are too honest,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd you canâ€™t trust anyone with something this big. You already know what Iâ€™m going to do with it. Thatâ€™s why, until we can agree on something better, youâ€™re leaving it with me.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œYes,â€� he said, â€œI guess I am.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Thirty-Eight: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The observation deck looked out over the Nauvoo as the behemoth slowly came together. Miller sat on the edge of a soft couch, his fingers laced over his knee, his gaze on the immense vista of the construction. After his time on Holdenâ€™s ship and, before that, in Eros, with its old-style closed architecture, a view so wide seemed artificial. The deck itself was wider than the Rocinante and decorated with soft ferns and sculpted ivies. The air recyclers were eerily quiet, and even though the spin gravity was nearly the same as Ceresâ€™, the Coriolis felt subtly wrong.</p>
      <p>Heâ€™d lived in the Belt his whole life, and heâ€™d never been anywhere that was designed so carefully for the tasteful display of wealth and power. It was pleasant as long as he didnâ€™t think about it too much.</p>
      <p>He wasnâ€™t the only one drawn to the open spaces of Tycho. A few dozen station workers sat in groups or walked through together. An hour before, Amos and Alex had gone by, deep in their own conversation, so he wasnâ€™t entirely surprised when, standing up and walking back toward the docks, he saw Naomi sitting by herself with a bowl of food cooling on a tray at her side. Her gaze was fixed on her hand terminal.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Naomi looked up, recognized him, and smiled distractedly.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>Miller nodded toward the hand terminal and shrugged a question.</p>
      <p>â€œComm data from that ship,â€� she said. It was always that ship, Miller noticed. The same way people would call a particularly godawful crime scene that place. â€œItâ€™s all tightbeam, so I thought it wouldnâ€™t be so hard to triangulate. Butâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot so much?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi lifted her eyebrows and sighed.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve been plotting orbits,â€� she said. â€œBut nothingâ€™s fitting. There could be relay drones, though. Moving targets the ship syugh.  Nstem was calibrated for that would send the message on to the actual station. Or another drone, and then the station, or who knows?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAny data coming off Eros?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI assume so,â€� Naomi said, â€œbut I donâ€™t know that it would be any easier to make sense of than this.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCanâ€™t your OPA friends do something?â€� Miller asked. â€œTheyâ€™ve got more processing power than one of these handhelds. Probably have a better activity map of the Belt too.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œProbably,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>He couldnâ€™t tell if she didnâ€™t trust this Fred that Holden had given them over to, or just needed to feel like the investigation was still hers. He considered telling her to back off it for a while, to let the others carry it, but he didnâ€™t see he had the moral authority to make that one stick.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Naomi said, an uncertain smile on her lips.</p>
      <p>Miller blinked.</p>
      <p>â€œYou were laughing a little,â€� Naomi said. â€œI donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever seen you laugh before. I mean, not when something was funny.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI was just thinking about something a partner of mine told me about letting cases go when you got pulled from them.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat did he say?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat itâ€™s like taking half a shit,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œHad a way with words, that one.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe was all right for an Earther,â€� Miller said, and something tickled at the back of his mind. Then, a moment later: â€œAh, Jesus. I may have something.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Havelock met him in an encrypted drop site that lived on a server cluster on Ganymede. The latency kept them from anything like real-time conversation. It was more like dropping notes, but it did the trick. The waiting made Miller anxious. He sat with his terminal set to refresh every three seconds.</p>
      <p>â€œWould you like anything else?â€� the woman asked. â€œAnother bourbon?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™d be great,â€� Miller said, and checked to see if Havelock had replied yet. He hadnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>Like the observation deck, the bar looked out on the Nauvoo, though from a slightly different angle. The great ship looked foreshortened, and arcs of energy lit it where a layer of ceramic was annealing. A bunch of religious zealots were going to load themselves into that massive ship, that small self-sustaining world, and launch themselves into the darkness between the stars. Generations would live and die in it, and if they were mind-bendingly lucky enough to find a planet worth living on the end of the journey, the people who came out of it would never have known Earth or Mars or the Belt. Theyâ€™d be aliens already. And if whatever had made the protomolecule was out there to greet them, then what?</p>
      <p>Would they all die like Julie had?</p>
      <p>There was life out there. They had proof of it now. And the proof came in the shape of a weapon, so what did that tell him? Except that maybe the Mormons deserved a little warning about what they were signing their great-grandkids up for.</p>
      <p>He laughed to himself when he realized that was exactly what Holden would say.</p>
      <p>The bourbon arrived at the same moment his hand terminal chimed. The video file had a layered encryption that took almost a minute to unpack. That alone was a good sign.</p>
      <p>The file opened, and Havelock grinned out from the screen. He was in better shape than heâ€™d been on Ceres, and it showed in the shape of his jaw. His skin was darker, but Miller didnâ€™t know if it was purely cosmetic or if his old partner had been basking in false sunlight for the joy of it. It didnâ€™t matter. It made the Earther look rich and fit.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, buddy,â€� Havelock said. â€œGood to hear from you. After what happened with Shaddid and the OPA, I was afraid we were going to be on different sides now. Iâ€™m glad you got out of there before the shit hit the fan.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, Iâ€™m still with Protogen, and Iâ€™ve got to tell you, these guys are kind of scary. I mean, Iâ€™ve worked contract security before, and Iâ€™m pretty clear when someoneâ€™s hard-core. These guys arenâ€™t cops. Theyâ€™re troops. You know what I mean?</p>
      <p>â€œOfficially, I donâ€™t know dick about a Belt station, but you know how it is. Iâ€™m from Earth. There are a lot of these guys who gave me shit about Ceres. Working with the vacuum-heads. That kind of thing. But the way things are here, itâ€™s better to be on the good side of the bad guys. Itâ€™s just that kind of job.â€�</p>
      <p>There was an apology in his expression. Miller understood. Working in some corporations was like going to prison. You adopted the views of the people around you. A Belter might get hired on, but heâ€™d never belong. Like Ceres, just pointed the other way. If Havelock had made friends with a set of inner planets mercs who spent their off nights curb-stomping Belters outside bars, then he had.</p>
      <p>But making friends didnâ€™t mean he was one of them.</p>
      <p>â€œSo. Off the record, yeah, thereâ€™s a black ops station in the Belt. I hadnâ€™t heard it called Thoth, but it could be. Some sort of very scary deep research and development lab. Heavy science crew, but not a huge place. I think discreet would be the word. Lots of automated defenses, but not a big ground crew.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t need to tell you that leaking the coordinates would get my ass killed out here. So wipe the file when youâ€™re done, and letâ€™s not talk again for a long, long time.â€�</p>
      <p>The datafile was small. Three lines of plaintext orbital notation. Miller put it into his hand terminal and killed the file off the Ganymede server. The bourbon still sat beside his hand, and he drank it off neat. The warmth in his chest might have been the alcohol or it might have been victory.</p>
      <p>He turned on the hand terminalâ€™s camera.</p>
      <p>â€œThanks. I owe you one. Hereâ€™s part of the payment. What happened on Eros? Protogen was part of it, and itâ€™s big. If you get the chance to drop your contract with them, do it. And if they try to rotate you out to that black ops station, donâ€™t go.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller frowned. The sad truth was that Havelock was probably the last real partner heâ€™d had. The only one whoâ€™d looked on him as an equal. As the kind of detective Miller had imagined himself to be.</p>
      <p>â€œTake care of yourself, partner,â€� he said, then ended the file, encrypted it, shipped it out. He had the bone-deep feeling he wasnâ€™t ever going to talk to Havelock again.</p>
      <p>He put through a connection request to Holden. The screen filled with the captainâ€™s open, charming, vaguely naive face.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller,â€� Holden said. â€œEverything okay?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah. Great. But I need to talk to your Fred guy. Can you arrange that?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden frowned and nodded at the same time.</p>
      <p>â€œSure. Whatâ€™s going on?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI know where Thoth Station is,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou know what?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œWhere the hell did you get that?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller grinned. â€œIf I gave you that information and it got out, a good man would get killed,â€� he said. â€œYou see how that works?â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>It struck Miller as he, Holden, and Naomi waited for Fred that he knew an awful lot of inner planets types fighting against the inner planets. Or at least not for them. Fred, supposedly a high-ranking OPA member. Havelock. Three-quarters of the crew of the Rocinante. Juliette Mao.</p>
      <p>It wasnâ€™t what he would have expected. But maybe that was shortsighted. He was seeing the thing the way Shaddid and Protogen did. There were two sides fightingâ€”that was true enoughâ€”but they werenâ€™t the inner planets versus the Belters. They were the people who thought it was a good idea to kill people who looked or acted differently against the people who didnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>Or maybe that was a crap analysis too. Because given the chance to put the scientist from the Protogen pitch, the board of directors, and whoever this Dresden piece of shit was into an airlock, Miller knew heâ€™d agonize about it for maybe half a second after he blew them all into vacuum. Didnâ€™t put him on the side of angels.</p>
      <p>â€œMr. Miller. What can I do for you?â€�</p>
      <p>Fred. The Earther OPA. He wore a blue button-down shirt and a nice pair of slacks. He could have been an architect or a mid-level administrator for any number of good, respectable corporations. Miller tried to imagine him coordinating a battle.</p>
      <p>â€œYou can convince me that youâ€™ve really got what it takes to kill the Protogen station,â€� Miller said. â€œThen Iâ€™ll tell you where it is.â€�</p>
      <p>Fredâ€™s eyebrows rose a millimeter.</p>
      <p>â€œCome into my office,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>Miller went. Holden and Naomi followed. When the doors closed behind them, Fred was the first to speak.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not sure exactly what you want from me. Iâ€™m not in the habit of making my battle plans public knowledge.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™re talking about storming a station,â€� Miller said. â€œSomething with damn good defenses and maybe more ships like the one that killed the Canterbury. No disrespect intended, but thatâ€™s a pretty tall order for a bunch of amateurs like the OPA.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAh, Miller?â€� Holden said. Miller held up a hand, cutting him off.</p>
      <p>â€œI can give you the directions to Thoth Station,â€� Miller said. â€œBut if I do that and it turns out you havenâ€™t got the punch to see this through, then a lot of people die and nothing gets resolved. Iâ€™m not up for that.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred cocked his head, like a dog hearing an unfamiliar sound. Naomi and Holden shared a glance that Miller couldnâ€™t parse.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is a war,â€� Miller said, warming to the subject. â€œIâ€™ve worked with the OPA before, and frankly you folks are a lot better at little guerrilla bullshit than at coordinating anything real. Half of the people who claim to speak for you are crackpots who happened to have a radio nearby. I see youâ€™ve got a lot of money. I see youâ€™ve got a nice office. What I donâ€™t seeâ€”what I need to seeâ€”is that youâ€™ve got what it takes to bring these bastards down. Taking out a station isnâ€™t a game. I donâ€™t care how many simulations youâ€™ve run. This is real now. If Iâ€™m going to help you, I need to know you can handle it.â€�</p>
      <p>There was a long silence.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller?â€� Naomi said. â€œYou know who Fred is, right?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Tycho mouthpiece for the OPA,â€� Miller said. â€œThat doesnâ€™t draw a whole lot of water with me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHeâ€™s Fred Johnson,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Fredâ€™s eyebrows rose another millimeter. Miller frowned and crossed his arms.</p>
      <p>â€œColonel Frederick Lucius Johnson,â€� Naomi said, clarifying.</p>
      <p>Miller blinked. â€œThe Butcher of Anderson Station?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œThe same,â€� Fred said. â€œI have been talking with the central council of the OPA. I have a cargo ship with more than enough troops to secure the station. Air support is a state-of-the-art Martian torpedo bomber.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Roci?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œThe Rocinante,â€� Fred agreed. â€œAnd while you may not believe it, I actually know what Iâ€™m doing.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller looked at his feet, then up toward Holden.</p>
      <p>â€œThat Fred Johnson?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œI thought you knew,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œWell. Donâ€™t I feel like the flaming idiot,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™ll pass,â€� Fred said. â€œWas there anything else you wanted to demand?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Miller said. And then: â€œYes. I want to be part of the ground assault. When we take that station crew, I want to be there.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAre you sure?â€� Fred said. â€œ â€˜Taking out a station isnâ€™t a game.â€™ What makes you think you have what it takes?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shrugged.</p>
      <p>â€œOne thing it takes is the coordinates,â€� Miller said. â€œI have got those.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred laughed. â€œMr. Miller. If youâ€™d like to go down to this station and have whateverâ€™s waiting for us down there try to kill you along with the rest of us, I wonâ€™t stand in your way.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThanks,â€� Miller said. He pulled up his hand terminal and sent the plaintext coordinates to Fred. â€œThere you go. My source is solid, but heâ€™s not working from firsthand data. We should confirm before we commit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not an amateur,â€� Colonel Fred Johnson said, looking at the file. Miller nodded, adjusted his hat, and walked out. Naomi and Holden flanked him. When they reached the wide, clean public hallway, Miller looked to his right, catching Holdenâ€™s eyes.</p>
      <p>â€œReally, I thought you knew,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Eight days later, the message came. The cargo ship Guy Molinari had arrived, full up with OPA soldiers. Havelockâ€™s coordinates had been verified. Something was sure as hell out there, and it appeared to be collecting the tightbeamed data from Eros. If Miller wanted to be part of this, the time had come to move out.</p>
      <p>He sat in his quarters in the Rocinante for what was likely the last time. He realized with a little twinge, equal parts surprise and sorrow, that he was going to miss the place. Holden, for all his faults and Millerâ€™s complaints, was a decent guy. In over his head and only half aware of the fact, but Miller could think of more than one person who fit that bill. He was going to miss Alexâ€™s odd, affected drawl and Amosâ€™ casual obscenity. He was going to wonder if and how Naomi ever worked things out with her captain.</p>
