      <h2>â€œYouâ€™ve got no idea,â€� Miller said. â€œListen, Semi....</h2>
      <p>â€œHolden that started the war?â€� Sematimba said.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s the one,â€� Miller said. â€œThis is deep. Drowning deep. And you know what they say about going in after a drowning man, right?â€�</p>
      <p>Sematimba looked down the corridor. He nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œLet me help you,â€� Sematimba said, but Miller shook his head.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m too far gone. Forget me. What happened was you got a call. You found the place. You donâ€™t know me, you donâ€™t know them, youâ€™ve got no clue what happened. Or you come along and drown with me. Your pick.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t leave the station without telling me?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œI can live with that,â€� Sematimba said. Then, a moment later: â€œThatâ€™s really Holden?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCall the coroner,â€� Miller said. â€œTrust me.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Twenty-Five: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Miller gestured at Holden and headed for the elevator without waiting to see if he was following. The presumption irritated him, but he went anyway.</p>
      <p>â€œSo,â€� Holden said, â€œwe were just in a gunfight where we killed at least three people, and now weâ€™re just leaving? No getting questioned or giving a statement? How exactly does that happen?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œProfessional courtesy,â€� Miller said, and Holden couldnâ€™t tell if he was joking.</p>
      <p>The elevator door opened with a muffled ding, and Holden and the others followed Miller inside. Naomi was closest to the panel, so she reached out to press the lobby button, but her hand was shaking so badly that she had to stop and clench it into a fist. After a deep breath, she reached out a now steady finger and pressed the button.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is bullshit. Being an ex-cop doesnâ€™t give you a license to get in gunfights,â€� Holden said to Millerâ€™s back.</p>
      <p>Miller didnâ€™t move, but he seemed to shrink a little bit. His sigh was heavy and unforced. His skin seemed grayer than before.</p>
      <p>â€œSematimba knows the score. Half the job is knowing when to look the other way. Besides, I promised we wouldnâ€™t leave the station without letting him know.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFuck that,â€� Amos said. â€œYou donâ€™t make promises for us, pal.â€�</p>
      <p>The elevator came to a stop and opened onto the bloody scene of the gunfight. A dozen cops were in the room. Miller nodded at them and they nodded back. He led the crew out of the lobby to the corridor, then turned around.</p>
      <p>â€œWe can work that out later,â€� Miller said. â€œRight now, letâ€™s get someplace we can talk.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden agreed with a shrug. â€œOkay, but youâ€™re paying.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller headed off down the corridor toward the tube station.</p>
      <p>As they followed, Naomi put a hand on Holdenâ€™s arm and slowed him down a bit so that Miller could get ahead. When he was far enough away, she said, â€œHe knew her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWho knew who?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe,â€� Naomi said, nodding at Miller, â€œknew her.â€� She jerked her head back toward the crime scene behind them.</p>
      <p>â€œHow do you know?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œHe wasnâ€™t expecting to find her there, but he knew who she was. Seeing her like that was a shock.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHuh, I didnâ€™t get that at all. Heâ€™s seemed like Mr. Cool all through this.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, they were friends or something. Heâ€™s having trouble dealing with it, so maybe donâ€™t push him too hard,â€� she said. â€œWe might need him.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The hotel room Miller got was only slightly better than the one theyâ€™d found the body in. Alex immediately headed for the bathrmmed ^oom and locked the door. The sound of water running in the sink wasnâ€™t quite loud enough to cover the pilotâ€™s retching.</p>
      <p>Holden plopped down on the small bedâ€™s dingy comforter, forcing Miller to take the roomâ€™s one uncomfortable-looking chair. Naomi sat next to Holden on the bed, but Amos stayed on his feet, prowling around the room like a nervous animal.</p>
      <p>â€œSo, talk,â€� Holden said to Miller.</p>
      <p>â€œLetâ€™s wait for the rest of the gang to finish up,â€� Miller replied with a nod toward the bathroom.</p>
      <p>Alex came out a few moments later, his face still white, but now freshly washed.</p>
      <p>â€œAre you all right, Alex?â€� Naomi asked in a soft voice.</p>
      <p>â€œFive by five, XO,â€� Alex said, then sat down on the floor and put his head in his hands.</p>
      <p>Holden stared at Miller and waited. The older man sat and played with his hat for a minute, then tossed it onto the cheap plastic desk that cantilevered out from the wall.</p>
      <p>â€œYou knew Julie was in that room. How?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWe didnâ€™t even know her name was Julie,â€� Holden replied. â€œWe just knew that it was someone from the Scopuli.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou should tell me how you knew that,â€� Miller said, a frightening intensity in his eyes.</p>
      <p>Holden paused a moment. Miller had killed someone who had been trying to kill them, and that certainly helped make the case that he was a friend, but Holden wasnâ€™t about to sell out Fred and his group on a hunch. He hesitated, then went halfway.</p>
      <p>â€œThe fictional owner of the Scopuli had checked into that flophouse,â€� he said. â€œIt made sense that it was a member of the crew raising a flag.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded. â€œWho told you?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not comfortable telling you that. We believed the information was accurate,â€� Holden replied. â€œThe Scopuli was the bait that someone used to kill the Canterbury. We thought someone from the Scopuli might know why everyone keeps trying to kill us.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller said, â€œShit,â€� and then leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve been looking for Julie. Youâ€™d hoped we were looking for her too. That we knew something,â€� Naomi said, not making it a question.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>It was Holdenâ€™s turn to ask why.</p>
      <p>â€œParents sent a contract to Ceres looking for her to be sent home. It was my case,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œSo you work for Ceres security?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot anymore.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo what are you doing here?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œHer family was connected to something,â€� Miller replied. â€œI just naturally hate a mystery.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd how did you know it was bigger than just a missing girl?â€�</p>
      <p>Talking to Miller felt like digging through granite with a rubber chisel. Miller grinned humorlessly.</p>
      <p>â€œThey fired me for looking too hard.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden consciously decided not to be annoyed by Millerâ€™s non-answer. â€œSo letâ€™s talk abn-an cs tout the death squad in the hotel.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, seriously, what the fuck?â€� Amos said, finally pausing in his pacing. Alex took his head out of his hands and looked up with interest for the first time. Even Naomi leaned forward on the edge of the bed.</p>
      <p>â€œNo idea,â€� Miller replied. â€œBut someone knew you were coming.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, thanks for the brilliant police work,â€� Amos said with a snort. â€œNo way we woulda figured that out on our own.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden ignored him. â€œBut they didnâ€™t know why, or they would have already gone up to Julieâ€™s room and gotten whatever they wanted.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDoes that mean Fredâ€™s been compromised?â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œFred?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œOr maybe someone figured out the Polanski thing too, but didnâ€™t have a room number,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œBut why come out guns blazing like that?â€� Amos said. â€œDoesnâ€™t make any sense to shoot us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat was a mistake,â€� Miller said. â€œI saw it happen. Amos here drew his gun. Somebody overreacted. They were yelling cease-fire right up until you folks started shooting back.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden began ticking off points on his fingers.</p>
      <p>â€œSo someone finds out weâ€™re headed to Eros, and that it is related to the Scopuli. They even know the hotel, but not the room.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey donâ€™t know itâ€™s Lionel Polanski either,â€� Naomi said. â€œThey could have looked it up at the desk, just like we did.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRight. So they wait for us to show, and have a squad of gunmen ready to take us in. But that goes to shit and it turns into a gunfight in the lobby. They absolutely donâ€™t see you coming, Detective, so they arenâ€™t omniscient.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRight,â€� Miller said. â€œThe whole thing screams last minute. Grab you guys and find out what youâ€™re looking for. If theyâ€™d had more time, they could have just searched the hotel. Might have taken two or three days, but it could have been done. They didnâ€™t, so that means grabbing you was easier.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden nodded. â€œYes,â€� he said. â€œBut that means that they already had teams here. Those didnâ€™t seem like locals to me.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller paused, looking disconcerted.</p>
      <p>â€œNow you say it, me either,â€� he agreed.</p>
      <p>â€œSo whoever it is, they already have teams of gunmen on Eros, and they can redeploy them to come at a momentâ€™s notice to pick us up,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd enough pull with security that they could have a firefight and nobody came,â€� Miller said. â€œPolice didnâ€™t know anything was happening until I called them.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden cocked his head to one side, then said, â€œShit, we really need to get out of here.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWait a minute,â€� Alex said loudly. â€œJust wait a goddamn minute here. How come no one is talkinâ€™ about the mutant horror show in that room? Was I the only one that saw that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, Jesus, what was that all about?â€� Amos said quietly.</p>
      <p>Miller reached into his coat pocket and took out the evidence bag with Julieâ€™s hand terminal in it.</p>
      <p>â€œAny of you guys a techie?â€� he askof y c€� ed. â€œMaybe we could find out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI could probably hack it,â€� Naomi said. â€œBut thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™m touching that thing until we know what did that to her and that it isnâ€™t catching. Iâ€™m not pushing my luck by handling anything sheâ€™s touched.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t have to touch it. Keep the bag sealed. Just use it right through the plastic. The touch screen should still work.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi paused for a second, then reached out and took the bag.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, give me a minute,â€� she said, then set to work on it.</p>
      <p>Miller leaned back in his chair again, letting out another heavy sigh.</p>
      <p>â€œSo,â€� Holden said. â€œDid you know Julie before this? Naomi seems to think finding her dead like that really knocked you for a loop.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shook his head slowly. â€œYou get a case like that, you look into whoever it is. You know, personal stuff. Read their e-mail. Talk to the people they know. You get a picture.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller stopped talking and rubbed his eyes with his thumbs. Holden didnâ€™t push him, but he started talking again anyway.</p>
      <p>â€œJulie was a good kid,â€� Miller said as if he were confessing something. â€œShe flew a mean racing ship. I justâ€¦ I wanted to get her back alive.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s got a password,â€� Naomi said, holding up the terminal. â€œI could hack the hardware, but Iâ€™d have to open the case.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller reached out and said, â€œLet me give it a try.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi handed the terminal to him, and he tapped a few characters on the screen and handed it back.</p>
      <p>â€œRazorback,â€� Naomi said. â€œWhatâ€™s that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s a sled,â€� Miller replied.</p>
      <p>â€œIs he talking to us?â€� Amos said, pointing his chin at Miller. â€œ â€™Cause thereâ€™s no one else here, but I swear half the time I donâ€™t know what the fuck heâ€™s on about.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSorry,â€� Miller said. â€œIâ€™ve been working more or less solo. Makes for bad habits.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi shrugged and went back to work with Holden and Miller now looking over her shoulders.</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™s got a lot of stuff on here,â€� Naomi said. â€œWhere to start?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller pointed at a text file simply labeled notes sitting on the terminalâ€™s desktop.</p>
      <p>â€œStart there,â€� he said. â€œSheâ€™s a fanatic about putting things in the right folders. If she left that on the desktop, it means she wasnâ€™t sure where it went.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi tapped on the document to open it up. It expanded into a loosely organized collection of text that read like someoneâ€™s diary.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>First off, get your shit together. Panic doesnâ€™t help. It never helps. Deep breaths, figure this out, make the right moves. fear is the mind-killer. Ha. Geek.Shuttle Pros:No reactor, just batteries. V. low radiation.Supplies for eightLots of reaction massShuttle Cons:No Epstein, no torchComm not just disabled, but physically removed (feeling a little paranoid about leaks, guys?)Closest transit is Eros. Is that where we were going? Maybe go someplace else? On just teakettle, this is gonna be a slow boat. Another transit adds seven more weeks. Eros, then.Iâ€™ve got the Phoebe bug, no way around it. Not sure how, but that brown shit was everywhere. Itâ€™s anaerobic, must have touched some. Doesnâ€™t matter how, just work the problem.I just slept for THREE WEEKS. Didnâ€™t even get up to pee. What does that?Iâ€™m so fucked.Things you need to remember:* BA834024112* Radiation kills. No reactor on this shuttle, but keep the lights off. Keep the e-suit on. Video asshat said this thing eats radiation. Donâ€™t feed it.* Send up a flag. Get some help. You work for the smartest people in the system. Theyâ€™ll figure something out.* Stay away from people. Donâ€™t spread the bug. Not coughing up the brown goo yet. No idea when that starts.* Keep away from bad guysâ€”as if you know who they are. Fine. So keep away from everyone. Incognito is my name. Hmm. Polanski?Damn. I can feel it. Iâ€™m hot all the time, and Iâ€™m starving. Donâ€™t eat. Donâ€™t feed it. Feed a cold, starve a flu? Other way around? Eros is a day out, and then help is on the way. Keep fighting.Safe on Eros. Sent up the flag. Hope the home office is watching. Head hurts. Somethingâ€™s happening on my back. Lump over my kidneys. Darren turned into goo. Am I going to be a suit full of jelly?Sick now. Things coming out of my back and leaking that brown stuff everywhere. Have to take the suit off. If you read this, donâ€™t let anyone touch the Brown stuff. Burn me. Iâ€™m burning up.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Naomi put the terminal down, but no one spoke for a moment. Finally, Holden said, â€œPhoebe bug. Anyone have an idea?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThere was a science station on Phoebe,â€� Miller said. â€œInner planets place, no Belters allowed. It got hit. Lots of dead people, butâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe talks about being on a shuttle,â€� Naomi said. â€œThe Scopuli didnâ€™t have a shuttle.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThere had to be another ship,â€� Alex said. â€œMaybe she got the shuttle off œMay cttlit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRight,â€� Holden said. â€œThey got on another ship, they got infected with this Phoebe bug, and the rest of the crewâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. Dies?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe gets out, not realizing sheâ€™s infected till sheâ€™s on the shuttle,â€� Naomi continued. â€œShe comes here, she sends up the flag to Fred, and she dies in that hotel room of the infection.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot, however, turned to goo,â€� Holden said. â€œJust really badlyâ€¦ I donâ€™t know. Those tubes and bone spurs. What kind of disease does that?â€�</p>
      <p>The question hung in the air. Again no one spoke. Holden knew they were all thinking the same thing. They hadnâ€™t touched anything in the flophouse room. Did that mean they were safe from it? Or did they have the Phoebe bug, whatever the hell it was? But sheâ€™d said anaerobic. Holden was pretty sure that meant you couldnâ€™t get it by breathing it in the air. Pretty sureâ€¦</p>
      <p>â€œWhere do we go from here, Jim?â€� Naomi asked.</p>
      <p>â€œHow about Venus?â€� Holden said, his voice higher and tighter than heâ€™d expected. â€œNothing interesting happening on Venus.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSeriously,â€� Naomi said.</p>
