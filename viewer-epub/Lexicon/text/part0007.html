			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-First"><span class="epi-source">PORTLAND, OR:</span> The maintenance worker who fatally shot two people before taking his own life, triggering an eight-hour shutdown of Portland International Airport, suffered from depression following the breakup of his marriage, friends and family said yesterday.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Amelio Gonzalez, 37, told a friend he had nothing left to live for after a court decision awarded full custody of his two children, 11 and 7, to his ex-wife, Melinda Gonzalez, three months ago.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">It is believed Mr. Gonzalez sought medical assistance and was prescribed antidepression medication.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Colleagues remain in disbelief at Mr. Gonzalez’s actions, describing him as a friendly, generous man who often went out of his way to help others.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">“Amelio was a flat-out nice guy,” said Jerome Webber, who worked with Mr. Gonzalez in aircraft maintenance for two years prior to the incident. “A little quiet, but anyone would be knocked around by [his circumstances]. He’s just the last guy you’d expect to ever do anything like this.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Airport management defended their hiring practices, saying all employees were subject to regular psychological checkups. Mr. Gonzalez passed such a check as recently as four weeks ago.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">“We are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this,” said George Aftercock, manager of security for Portland International Airport. “We want to know how a model employee can suddenly snap.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Amelio Gonzalez shot two people on Saturday. A third person, a woman, is believed to have died in a car accident while trying to flee. Their names have not yet been released.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-Last">An earlier disturbance in which a man ran through the Arrivals hall in an agitated state, initially thought to be connected to the shooting, has since been found to be unrelated.</p>
