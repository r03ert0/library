      <h2>â€œIâ€™ve fucked everything up,â€� Holden blurted out...</h2>
      <p>Naomi just nodded, then reached across the table and took his hand in hers.</p>
      <p>â€œI need a win, Naomi,â€� he continued. â€œI need to do something that makes a difference. Fate or Karma or God or whatever dropped me in the middle of this thing, and I need to know Iâ€™m making a difference.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi smiled at him and squeezed his hand.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re cute when youâ€™re being noble,â€� she said. â€œBut you need to stare off into the distance more.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re making fun of me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� she said. â€œI am. Want to come home with me?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€”â€� Holden started, then stopped and stared at her, looking for the joke. Naomi was still smiling at him, nothing in her eyes but warmth and a touch of mischief. While he watched, one curly lock of hair fell over her eye, and she pushed it up without looking away from him. â€œWait, what? I thought youâ€™dâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI said donâ€™t tell me you love me to get me into bed,â€� she said. â€œBut I also said Iâ€™d have gone to your cabin anytime you asked over the last four years. I didnâ€™t think I was being subtle, and Iâ€™m sort of tired of waiting.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden leaned back in the booth and tried to remember to breathe. Naomiâ€™s grin changed to pure mischief now, and one eyebrow went up.</p>
      <p>â€œYou okay, sailor?â€� she asked.</p>
      <p>â€œI thought you were avoiding me,â€� he said once he was capable of speech. â€œIs this your way of giving me a win?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t be insulting,â€� she said, though there was no hint of anger in her voice. â€œBut Iâ€™ve waited weeks for you to get your nerve up, and the shipâ€™s almost done. That means youâ€™ll probably volunteer us for something really stupid and this time our luck will run out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWellâ€”â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œIf that happens without us at least giving this a try once, I will be very unhappy about it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi, Iâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s simple, Jim,â€� she said, reaching out for his hand and pulling him back toward her. She leaned across the table between them until their faces were almost touching. â€œItâ€™s a yes or no question.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Forty-Four: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Miller sat by himself, staring out the wide observation windows without seeing the view. The fungal-culture whiskey on the low black table beside him remained at the same level in the glass as when heâ€™d bought it. It wasnâ€™t really a drink. It was permission to sit. There had always been a handful of drifters, even on Ceres. Men and women whose luck had run out. No place to go, no one to ask favors of. No connection to the vast net of humanity. Heâ€™d always felt a kind of sympathy for them, his spiritual kindred.</p>
      <p>Now he was part of that disconnected tribe in earnest.</p>
      <p>Something bright happened on the skin of the great generation shipâ€”a welding array firing off some intricate network of subtle connection, maybe. Past the Nauvoo, nestled in the constant hive-like activity of Tycho Station, was a half-degree arc of the Rocinante, like aof th ~ home heâ€™d once had. He knew the story of Moses seeing a promised land he would never enter. Miller wondered how the old prophet would have felt if heâ€™d been ushered in for a momentâ€”a day, a week, a yearâ€”and then dropped back out in the desert. Kinder never to leave the wastelands. Safer.</p>
      <p>Beside him, Juliette Mao watched him from the corner of his mind carved out for her.</p>
      <p>I was supposed to save you, he thought. I was supposed to find you. Find the truth.</p>
      <p>And didnâ€™t you?</p>
      <p>He smiled at her, and she smiled back, as world-weary and tired as he was. Because of course he had. Heâ€™d found her, heâ€™d found who killed her, and Holden was right. Heâ€™d taken revenge. All that heâ€™d promised himself, heâ€™d done. Only it hadnâ€™t saved him.</p>
      <p>â€œCan I get you anything?â€�</p>
      <p>For half a second, Miller thought Julie had said it. The serving girl had opened her mouth to ask him again before he shook his head. She couldnâ€™t. And even if she had been able to, he couldnâ€™t afford it.</p>
      <p>You knew it couldnâ€™t last, Julie said. Holden. His crew. You knew you didnâ€™t really belong there. You belong with me.</p>
      <p>A sudden shot of adrenaline revved his tired heart. He looked around for her, but Julie was gone. His own privately generated fight-or-flight reaction didnâ€™t have room for daydream hallucinations. And still. You belong with me.</p>
      <p>He wondered how many people heâ€™d known who had taken that path. Cops had a tradition of eating their guns that went back to long before humanity had lifted itself up the gravity well. Here he was, without a home, without a friend, with more blood on his hands from the past month than from his whole career before it. The in-house shrink on Ceres called it suicidal ideation in his yearly presentation to the security teams. Something to watch out for, like genital lice or high cholesterol. Not a big deal if you were careful.</p>
      <p>So heâ€™d be careful. For a while. See where it went.</p>
      <p>He stood, hesitated for three heartbeats, then scooped up his bourbon and drank it in a gulp. Liquid courage, they called it, and it seemed to do the trick. He pulled up his terminal, put in a connect request, and tried to compose himself. He wasnâ€™t there yet. And if he was going to live, he needed a job.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œSabez nichts, Pampaw,â€� Diogo said. The kid was wearing a meshwork shirt and pants cut in a fashion as youthful as it was ugly, and in his previous life, Miller would probably have written him off as too young to know anything useful. Now Miller waited. If anything could wring a prospect out of Diogo, it would be the promise of Miller getting a hole of his own. The silence dragged. Miller forced himself not to speak for fear of begging.</p>
      <p>â€œWellâ€¦ â€� Diogo said warily. â€œWell. Thereâ€™s one hombre might could. Just arm and eye.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSecurity guard workâ€™s fine with me,â€� Miller said. â€œAnything that pays the bills.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIl conversa Ã¡ do. Hear whatâ€™s said.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI appreciate anything you can do,â€� Miller replied, then gestured at the bed. â€œYou mind if Iâ€¦?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMi cama es su cama,â€� Diogo said. Miller lay down.</p>
      <p>Diogo stepped into the small shower, and the sound of water against flesh drowned out the air cycler. Even on board ship, Miller hadnâ€™t lived in physical circumstances this intimate with anyone since his marriage. Still, he wouldnâ€™t have gone as far as to call Diogo a friend.</p>
      <p>Opportunity was thinner on Tycho than heâ€™d hoped, and he didnâ€™t have much by way of references. The few people who knew him werenâ€™t likely to speak on his behalf. But surely thereâ€™d be something. All he needed was a way to remake himself, to start over and be someone different from who heâ€™d been.</p>
      <p>Assuming, of course, that Earth or Marsâ€”whichever one came out on top of the warâ€”didnâ€™t then wipe the OPA and all the stations loyal to it out of the sky. And that the protomolecule didnâ€™t escape Eros and slaughter a planet. Or a station. Or him. He had a momentâ€™s chill, recalling that there was still a sample of the thing on board the Roci. If something happened with it, Holden and Naomi, Alex and Amos might all join Julie long before Miller did.</p>
      <p>He told himself that wasnâ€™t his problem anymore. Still, he hoped theyâ€™d be all right. He wanted them to be well, even if he wasnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>â€œOi, Pampaw,â€� Diogo said as the door to the public hall slid open. â€œYou hear that Eros started talking?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller lifted himself to one elbow.</p>
      <p>â€œSÃ­,â€� Diogo said. â€œWhatever that shit is, it started broadcasting. Thereâ€™s even words and shit. Iâ€™ve got a feed. You want a listen?â€�</p>
      <p>No, Miller thought. No, I have seen those corridors. Whatâ€™s happened to those people almost happened to me. I donâ€™t want anything to do with that abomination.</p>
      <p>â€œSure,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Diogo scooped up his own hand terminal and keyed in something. Millerâ€™s terminal chimed that it had received the new feed route.</p>
      <p>â€œChicÃ¡ perdÃ­da in ops been mixing a bunch of it to bhangra,â€� Diogo said, making a shifting dance move with his hips. â€œHard-core, eh?â€�</p>
      <p>Diogo and the other OPA irregulars had breached a high-value research station, faced down one of the most powerful and evil corporations in a history of power and evil. And now they were making music from the screams of the dying. Of the dead. They were dancing to it in the low-rent clubs. What it must be like, Miller thought, to be young and soulless.</p>
      <p>But no. That wasnâ€™t fair. Diogo was a good kid. He was just naive. The universe would take care of that, given a little time.</p>
      <p>â€œHard-core,â€� Miller said. Diogo grinned.</p>
      <p>The feed sat in queue, waiting. Miller turned out the lights, letting the little bed bear him up against the press of spin. He didnâ€™t want to hear. He didnâ€™t want to know. He had to.</p>
      <p>At first, the sound was nothingâ€”electric squeals and a wildly fluting static. Then, maybe somewhere deep in the back of it, music. A chorus of violas churning away together in a long, distant crescendo. And then, as clear as if someone were speaking into a microphone, a voice.</p>
      <p>â€œRabbits and hamsters. Ecologically unstabilizing and round and blue as moonbeams. August.â€�</p>
      <p>It almost certainly wasnâ€™t a real person. The computer systems on Eros could generate any number of perfectly convincing dialects and voices. Menâ€™s, womenâ€™s, childrenâ€™s. And how many ™s, che a many ™millions of hours of data could there be on the computers and storage dumps all through the station?</p>
      <p>Another electronic flutter, like finches looped back against themselves. A new voiceâ€”feminine and soft this timeâ€”with a throbbing pulse behind it.</p>
      <p>â€œPatient complains of rapid heartbeat and night sweats. Symptom onset reported as three months previous, but with a historyâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>The voice faded, and the throbbing rose. Like an old man with Swiss cheese holes in his brain, the complex system that had been Eros was dying, changing, losing its mind. And because Protogen had wired it all for sound, Miller could listen to the station fail.</p>
      <p>â€œI didnâ€™t tell him, I didnâ€™t tell him, I didnâ€™t tell him. The sunrise. Iâ€™ve never seen the sunrise.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller closed his eyes and slid down toward sleep, serenaded by Eros. As consciousness faded, he imagined a body in the bed beside him, warm and alive and breathing slowly in time with the rise and fall of the static.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The manager was a thin man, weedy, with hair combed high above his brow like a wave that never crashed. The office hunched close around them, humming at odd moments when the infrastructureâ€”water, air, energyâ€”of Tycho impinged on it. A business built between ducts, improvisational and cheap. The lowest of the low.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m sorry,â€� the manager said. Miller felt his gut tighten and sink. Of all the humiliations the universe had in store for him, this one he hadnâ€™t foreseen. It made him angry.</p>
      <p>â€œYou think I canâ€™t handle it?â€� he asked, keeping his voice soft.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not that,â€� the weedy man said. â€œItâ€™sâ€¦ Look, between us, weâ€™re looking for a thumb, you know? Someoneâ€™s idiot kid brother could guard this warehouse. Youâ€™ve got all this experience. What do we need with riot control protocols? Or investigative procedure? I mean, come on. This gig doesnâ€™t even come with a gun.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t care,â€� Miller said. â€œI need something.â€�</p>
      <p>The weedy man sighed and gave the exaggerated shrug of a Belter.</p>
      <p>â€œYou need something else,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Miller tried not to laugh, afraid it would sound like despair. He stared at the cheap plastic wall behind the manager until the guy started to get uncomfortable. It was a trap. He was too experienced to start over. He knew too much, so there was no going back and doing fresh beginnings.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right,â€� he said at last, and the manager across the desk from him let out a breath, then had the good grace to look embarrassed.</p>
      <p>â€œCan I just ask,â€� the weedy man said. â€œWhy did you leave your old job?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCeres changed hands,â€� Miller said, putting on his hat. â€œI wasnâ€™t on the new team. That was all.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCeres?â€�</p>
      <p>The manager looked confused, which in turn confused Miller. He glanced down at his own hand terminal. There was his work history, just the way heâ€™d presented it. The manager couldnâ€™t have missed it.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s where I was,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œFor the police thing. But I meant the last job. I mean, Iâ€™vant thhei Iâ€™vae been around, I understand not putting OPA work on your resume, but you have to figure we all know that you were part of the thingâ€¦ you know, with the station. And all.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou think I was working for the OPA,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>The weedy man blinked.</p>
      <p>â€œYou were,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Which, after all, was true.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Nothing had changed in Fred Johnsonâ€™s office, and everything had. The furnishings, the smell of the air, the sense of its existing somewhere between a boardroom and a command and control center. The generation ship outside the window might have been half a percent closer to completion, but that wasnâ€™t it. The stakes of the game had shifted, and what had been a war was something else now. Something bigger. It shone in Fredâ€™s eyes and tightened his shoulders.</p>
      <p>â€œWe could use a man with your skills,â€� Fred agreed. â€œItâ€™s always the small-scale things that trip you up. How to frisk someone. That kind of thing. Tycho security can handle themselves, but once weâ€™re off our station and shooting our way into someone elseâ€™s, not as much.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIs that something youâ€™re looking to do more of?â€� Miller said, trying to make it a casual joke. Fred didnâ€™t answer. For a moment, Julie stood at the generalâ€™s side. Miller saw the pair of them reflected in the screens, the man pensive, the ghost amused. Maybe Miller had gotten it wrong from the start, and the divide between the Belt and the inner planets was something besides politics and resource management. He knew as well as anyone that the Belt offered a harder, more dangerous life than Mars or Earth provided. And yet it called these peopleâ€”the best peopleâ€”out of humanityâ€™s gravity wells to cast themselves into the darkness.</p>
      <p>The impulse to explore, to stretch, to leave home. To go as far as possible out into the universe. And now that Protogen and Eros offered the chance to become gods, to recreate humanity into beings that could go beyond merely human hopes and dreams, it occurred to Miller how hard it would be for men like Fred to turn that temptation away.</p>
      <p>â€œYou killed Dresden,â€� Fred said. â€œThatâ€™s a problem.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt needed to happen.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not sure it did,â€� Fred replied, but his voice was careful. Testing. Miller smiled, a little sadly.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s why it needed to happen,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>The small, coughing laugh told Miller that Fred understood him. When the general turned back to consider him again, his gaze was steady.</p>
      <p>â€œWhen it comes to the negotiating table, someoneâ€™s going to have to answer for it. You killed a defenseless man.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI did,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhen the time comes, I will hand-feed you to the wolves as the first chip I offer. I wonâ€™t protect you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWouldnâ€™t ask you to protect me,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œEven if it meant being a Belter ex-cop in an Earth-side prison?â€�</p>
      <p>It was a euphemism, and they both knew it. You belong with me, Julie said. And so what did it matter, really, how he got there?</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve got no regrets,â€� heâ€œIâ€ reâ€� heâ said, and half a breath later was shocked to discover it was almost true. â€œIf thereâ€™s a judge out there who wants to ask me about something, Iâ€™ll answer. Iâ€™m looking for a job here, not protection.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred sat in his chair, eyes narrow and thoughtful. Miller leaned forward in his seat.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve got me in a hard position,â€� Fred said. â€œYouâ€™re saying all the right things. But I have a hard time trusting that youâ€™d follow through. Keeping you on the books would be risky. It could undermine my position in the peace negotiations.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s a risk,â€� Miller said. â€œBut Iâ€™ve been on Eros and Thoth station. I flew on the Rocinante with Holden and his crew. When it comes to analysis of the protomolecule and how we got into this mess, there isnâ€™t anyone in a better position to give you information. You can argue I knew too much. That I was too valuable to let go.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOr too dangerous.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure. Or that.â€�</p>
      <p>They were silent for a moment. On the Nauvoo, a bank of lights glittered in a gold-and-green test pattern and then went dark.</p>
      <p>â€œSecurity consultant,â€� Fred said. â€œIndependent. I wonâ€™t give you a rank.â€�</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m too dirty for the OPA, Miller thought with a glow of amusement.</p>
      <p>â€œIf it comes with my own bunk, Iâ€™ll take it,â€� he said. It was only until the war was over. After that, he was meat for the machine. That was fine. Fred leaned back. His chair hissed softly into its new configuration.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right,â€� Fred said. â€œHereâ€™s your first job. Give me your analysis. Whatâ€™s my biggest problem?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œContainment,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou think I canâ€™t keep the information about Thoth station and the protomolecule quiet?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOf course you canâ€™t,â€� Miller said. â€œFor one thing, too many people already know. For another thing, one of themâ€™s Holden, and if he hasnâ€™t already broadcast the whole thing on every empty frequency, he will soon. And besides that, you canâ€™t make a peace deal without explaining what the hellâ€™s going on. Sooner or later, it has to come out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd what do you advise?â€�</p>
      <p>For a moment, Miller was back in the darkness, listening to the gibbers of the dying station. The voices of the dead calling to him from across the vacuum.</p>
      <p>â€œDefend Eros,â€� he said. â€œAll sides are going to want samples of the protomolecule. Locking down access is going to be the only way you get yourself a seat at that table.â€�</p>
