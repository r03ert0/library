			<p class="x03-Chapter-Number">[FIVE]</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">They left the freeway and passed through a series of snow-sunk towns. Wil fell asleep without meaning to and woke from guns and blood and dead girls. There was drool on his chin. In the high beams, the road glittered and vanished into night thick as a blanket. “Where are we?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Safe.” Tom peered at the road. “Almost.” They were slowing. The pickup truck’s lights swung across a driveway. Wil saw a wire fence and wooden posts and a sign that said: <span class="SCAP1">MCCORMACK &amp; SONS STOCK SALES</span>. They came to a stop and the pickup gargled. “Hmm,” Tom said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you trust me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do I trust you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I phrased that badly,” Tom said. “I mean, if I tell you your life depends on doing exactly as I say, without hesitation, can I rely on you to do it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure,” Wil said, then, because that didn’t sound very plausible, added, “Maybe.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s not really good enough. <em class="calibre1">Maybe</em> leaves you <em class="calibre1">maybe</em> alive.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I thought we were meeting your friends.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We are.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So what’s the problem?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom gazed at the sign. “Nothing. There’s no problem.” He harassed the gearshift. The truck rolled into the driveway. It was thick with mud, dark tire tracks clearly visible. Tom pushed them forward two hundred yards, then paused at a fork. To the left, the road disappeared into darkness. To the right was a bare light on a pole. Within its sphere of illumination lay nothing but mud. Tom steered toward it. Their tires slipped briefly, found traction.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is this place?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Metal railings appeared beside them for a while, then vanished again. They entered an open expanse of mud. The ground seemed oddly chewed up. They reached the pole and came to a halt. The engine idled. Tom pressed a button; the doors went <em class="calibre1">ka-chunk</em>. He took the shotgun from the footwell and laid it across his lap.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What are we doing?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Quiet.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was no noise but the engine. “Should I have a gun?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom glanced at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If we’re in danger, and I’m doing what you say, then how about I have a gun?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That would increase the danger,” Tom said. “To me.” He peered into the dark.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil saw motion in the darkness. A man ran toward them, waving his arms. His jacket blew. He had long, straggly hair. He reached the truck and slapped the hood, grinning. Wil’s window whirred down.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hey! Goddamn!” said the long-haired man. “Is this him? This really him?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where are the others?” Tom said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Inside.” The man’s eyes crawled over Wil. “Holy shit, I cannot believe you found him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can’t see an inside.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s a house.” The man gestured into the dark, his eyes not leaving Wil. “Get out of the truck. I’ll take you in.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where can I put the truck?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t worry about the truck. Leave it. We’re gone in ten minutes.” The man tried Wil’s door handle. “Let’s move.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why’d you come running out like that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m excited, Eliot! I’m psyched!” He tried the door again. “This is what we’ve been working for! This gives us a fucking chance!” He grinned.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom’s head turned, examining the darkness. Wil didn’t know what he was looking for.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have the plane. Fueled up, sitting on a strip out back. We’ve got drugs, we’ve got a big fucking probe, twenty minutes we’re in the air and pulling this guy’s head open.” The man looked at him. “Nothing personal. But we need what’s in there more than you do.” He tried to rap Wil’s head with his knuckles. “Man! I could kiss you!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom said, “You realize how much emotion you’re displaying right now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The long-haired man looked at him. Then he lunged at Wil, grabbing his head, his fingers raking his skin. He forced his shoulders inside the car. His shoes scrabbled at the door. Tom hit the gas; the truck lurched forward. The long-haired man yelped and slipped and for a second Wil thought he was going to be dragged right out of the car. Then the fingers lost their grip on his head and neck and the man disappeared.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Fuck!</em>” he said. “What’s happening?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Bad things,” said Tom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s your friend?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. Not at the moment.” Metal gleamed ahead. It was railing, the same kind that had guided them down the driveway. For a moment Wil thought Tom was going to try to smash through it. Then they swung in a semicircle. The railing curved endlessly. “Oh, I see,” said Tom. “We’re in a pen.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A pen?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Cattle yard.” He backed the truck around. Now they were facing the light pole. The long-haired man shambled out of the light toward them. Tom shifted gears. The pickup’s wheels spun in mud.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” said Wil. “Oh, wait, no.” The long-haired man grew in the windshield. At the last moment, Tom jagged left and the long-haired man thumped against the side of the truck. In the red glow of taillights, Wil saw him pick himself up out of the mud and begin to shamble after them. “You hit your friend,” Wil said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom braked. Wil caught himself. He looked at Tom. “What are you doing?” Tom didn’t answer. “Your friend is coming.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop calling him my friend.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, that fucking guy is coming. He’s twenty feet away.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom’s eyes flicked to the mirror.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Seriously. Time to go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The long-haired man slapped the rear window. He ran to Wil’s door and tried to tug it open with one hand. The other hung at a broken angle. The man gave a frustrated cry. His fingers scrabbled against the glass. His eyes kept moving to Wil, tight and hungry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The driveway is a funnel,” said Tom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So let’s—” The man threw his head against the glass with a <em class="calibre1">crack</em>. “Let’s try something, you know?” Tom didn’t respond. The man head-butted the window again. “Please. Tom. Don’t make me sit here and watch this guy kill himself against the window.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Light flared ahead. Wil shielded his eyes. Something coughed and snarled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Aha,” said Tom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Truck.” Tom shifted into reverse and threw an elbow over the seat. “Big truck.” Ahead, the lights shivered. The snarl rose to a throaty roar. The man with the straggly hair fell to the mud and rose again. They swung in a half circle and Tom threw them into drive. As they bounced away from the driveway, Wil saw darkness coalesce into a shape. It was an animal transport, as large as a house, a grille like a grin. Smoke belched from twin exhausts above its cabin. As it moved into the pen, light fell across bright red cursive script on its front: <em class="calibre1">Faithful Bethany</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have to get out of here.” Their headlights bounced off metal railing. “Can we break through that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.” Tom hauled the wheel.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How do you know? Maybe we can break—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If we could break through, they would have chosen somewhere else.” The transport filled the windshield. Tom accelerated toward it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What are you . . . what are you . . . Jesus!” He threw out his hands. Tom yanked the wheel. The pickup jumped. The transport clipped them and everything leaned and spun. Then the tires bit. They accelerated toward the driveway and freedom beyond for ten glorious seconds and then Tom braked again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil, who had been straining forward, hit the dash and fell back in his seat. The pickup came to a halt at the driveway mouth. There were lumps in the mud. Big lumps. People, he saw. Three people, sitting.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Who are they?” He looked at Tom. “Poets?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why are they just sitting there?” A woman had a short black bob. Behind her was a teenage boy. Then an older man with white hair. They were looking at the pickup, their faces washed out by its lights, not moving.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Light grew within the cabin. Wil turned. The transport vehicle had completed a slow turn and was trundling toward them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You bitch,” Tom said, like he was pointing out the sights. “You murderous, goddamn bitch.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tom. The truck.” Tom revved the pickup’s engine, but did not shift gear. “The truck, Tom.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom hauled the wheel. They accelerated alongside the railing, heading back into the pen. They gained speed and passed by the transport’s churning wheels. The straggly-haired man appeared. Tom jerked the wheel but they were going too fast and he bounced off the hood and over the roof. Railing appeared ahead. It looked as if Tom was going to try to crash through it, but Wil knew this couldn’t be the case, because Tom had said that was impossible, and then he realized it was, and closed his eyes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The world lifted. He became an object. A thing with no control over its motion. The ground revolved and unexpectedly slapped him and everything went quiet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He swallowed. He blinked. These were things he could do. He tried to move his head but the gravity was wrong. It was tugging him sideways. He went to rub his eyes and missed. A lot was wrong with this situation and he wasn’t sure where to start.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Gug</em>,” said Tom. Tom was leaning over the steering wheel. He must be having some problems with gravity, too, because he was above Wil’s head. Maybe that was why he was hanging on to the wheel.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Lights moved across the dash. Not good lights, Wil recalled. He fumbled at his seat belt, got it, and fell against his door. The window was painted white. It took him a moment before he identified it as snow. Snow on the ground. The pickup was lying on its side. He tried the handle, just in case, but the ground didn’t move.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have to go.” Tom wasn’t holding on to the steering wheel, he realized. The wheel had come out of the dash and was holding Tom. “Are you okay? What do I do?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Gug.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He got a foot on the dash and strained past Tom for the driver’s side door. When he did this his shoulder collected Tom’s face and his knee went into Tom’s ribs and Tom groaned. But he got his arms out of the truck and levered his body into the freezing night air. The animal transport was completing a turn, its lights sweeping the ground. “Hey. Tom. I’ll lift you out.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom shook his head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Come on. You need to get out of there.” Light splashed him. He looked up. Silhouetted before the transport was a shambling figure. The man. His arms hung. One leg dragged. He reached a torn place they had made in the cattle yard’s railing and began to painfully climb through. “That guy is coming.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Gug.</em>” Tom’s head bobbed toward the footwell. Wil saw the butt of the shotgun. Not <em class="calibre1">gug</em>, he realized. <em class="calibre1">Gun.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not going to shoot people. Let me help you out.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Gun.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The straggly-haired man negotiated the wrecked railing and began to wade through the snow. That would become a lot easier soon, Wil saw, because in about ten feet there was a nice, cleared path where the pickup had returned to earth and started sliding. The snow there was red, drenched by the pickup’s taillights.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Take. It,” said Tom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No!” The straggly-haired man reached the rear of the pickup and began to climb. Wil heard his shoes scraping against the tailpipe. “I’m not going to murder him!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Hand slapped against the tailgate. The man’s head appeared.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shit,” Wil said, and pulled the shotgun from the door. He raised it to his shoulder and set it there. “Stop, you asshole!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Shoo im</em>,” Tom said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The man’s torso flopped onto the side of the pickup’s bed. He swung a leg up and Wil saw the jeans were dark with blood, the denim poking out in odd places. The man strained. His leg slipped off the pickup and he began trying to swing it up again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop fucking climbing!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Safe . . . ty,” said Tom. “Button. On. Side.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m Australian; I know how to use a shotgun!” He took a hand off the gun, squeezed it into a fist for circulation. “<em class="calibre1">Stop, you motherfucker!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The man rose on one leg and balanced awkwardly. His face was caked with dirt and blood. He looked intent and focused and not at all concerned about the gun Wil was pointing at him. He began to navigate along the side of the pickup’s bed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck,” Wil said, and pulled the trigger. The gun boomed. The man fell off the truck. Wil dropped the shotgun without thinking. “Goddammit fuck!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Good,” said Tom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The transport’s engine bellowed. Its exhausts hissed; its wheels began to turn.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Now,” said Tom. “Help me, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil reached down and grasped Tom’s wrist. By the time he got Tom out of the cabin, the transport was close. They jumped into deep, shadowed snow. He began to forge forward. He made it out of the shade of the pickup and his shadow stretched out before him, long and thin and sharpening at the edges, coalescing into something vulnerable. The ground shook. There was a shriek of metal and Wil thought, <em class="calibre1">It’s through the railing; it’s thirty feet away</em>, and he didn’t need to turn and verify this but did anyway. The transport bounced toward the pickup and swatted it aside. The idea of running suddenly seemed very stupid to Wil, because the transport was as big as a mountain. It was going to run him down no matter what he did.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom grabbed him by the ear. The transport hit deep snow and threw it up in a wave. Wil hadn’t factored in the snow: That would slow it. He realized he could survive, or could have, had he thought of this about ten seconds ago. The truck plowed toward him, fountaining snow. It slowed and stopped. Its tires spun. Wil reached out and touched its bull bar.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom climbed the grille and raised the shotgun. The driver was a woman, Wil saw. Early forties. Glasses, kind of bookish. Not the sort of person he would have expected to try to kill him with an animal truck. She looked at Tom with an expression of mild intent and reached for a pistol that lay on the dash.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom fired through the windshield. Wil looked away. In the light, the snow was diamonds. A trillion tiny diamonds.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom dropped beside him. “Move.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He trudged through the snow. They didn’t speak. Beyond the reach of the transport’s headlights, the snow grew waist deep. Wil’s breath steamed. Eventually, he said, “I can’t keep going.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom looked at him. There was something terrible about his face. Tom looked at the cattle yard. Then, abruptly, he sat. He began to dig shells out of his coat pocket and feed them into the shotgun.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil sat beside him, panting. The transport was perhaps five hundred yards away, its lights blazing. He could see the hole in its windshield. “Was that Woolf?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom looked at him. “What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That woman.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No,” Tom said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If that was Woolf, I would be weeping hot tears of joy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Your hometown, Broken Hill? Woolf did that. Not a chemical spill. Woolf. I would be dancing a jig if that was Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Got it,” Wil said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not Woolf,” Tom said. “Not Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They sat in silence. Nothing moved but the wind. “Did you know that woman in the transport?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why did she try to kill us?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom didn’t answer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil shivered. He was wearing a T-shirt. “I’m cold.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom dropped the shotgun and lunged at him. Wil yelped, falling backward, and Tom grabbed his shirt, pulled him up, thrust him back to the snow, pulled him up again, and shoved him down. “What,” Wil gasped. Tom grabbed a handful of snow and mashed it into Wil’s mouth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re cold?” Tom said. “You’re cold?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He released Wil. By the time Wil sat up, Tom had resumed his position and was facing the distant truck. Wil brushed snow from his face. “I’m sorry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You need to be better than this,” Tom said. “You need to be worth it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil folded his hands beneath his armpits and looked at the sky.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So far, you’re not worth shit.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay, look, I didn’t ask to be kidnapped.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Saved</em>, is another way of putting it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I didn’t ask to be saved.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Go, then.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not saying I want to <em class="calibre1">go</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Leave. See how long you last.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not saying that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You useless fuck,” said Tom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I did shoot a guy. I mean, not to overstate my contribution, but I did just fucking shoot a guy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom exhaled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And I pulled you out of the pickup.” A deep, numbing cold sunk into his body. He opened his mouth to give his jaw muscles something to do. “You didn’t run over those people.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom looked at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We could have gotten away. You just had to run over them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah,” Tom said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why didn’t you?” Tom didn’t answer. “You shot that woman.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Brontë.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Her name was Brontë.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“As in . . . Charlotte Brontë? A poet? I thought <em class="calibre1">they</em> were poets.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom didn’t reply.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” Wil said. “I get it. That guy called you Eliot. You’re Tom Eliot. Right? T. S. Eliot. You’re a poet.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom sighed. “Was.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You <em class="calibre1">were</em> a poet? What are you now?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not sure,” Tom said. “Ex-poet, I guess.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why did your friends turn bad?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They were compromised.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What does that mean?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Woolf got to them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What does—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It means she’s very persuasive.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Persuasive? She’s persuasive?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I told you, poets are good with words.” Tom stood. Snow fell from his coat. “Time to go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re telling me Woolf persuaded them to try to murder us? As in, she said, ‘Hey, how about you trap your buddy Tom Eliot in a cattle yard and try to run him down with a truck,’ and they <em class="calibre1">did</em>? Because she’s <em class="calibre1">persuasive?</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I said very persuasive. Get up.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was nothing but snow in every direction. “Where are we going?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I had a thought,” said Tom. “Maybe the plane really is here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">They trudged through blackness and snow until Wil could no longer feel anything. His nerves retreated somewhere deep inside, where there was still warmth. His nose was a memory. He had not only never been this cold, he had not understood this degree of cold was possible. He began to hope poets found them, because whatever happened at least it would be warm.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stumbled. “Aha!” said Tom. “Runway.” Wil couldn’t see him. “Let’s try . . . this way.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After a few minutes, the stars began to vanish. There were noises. Tom took his arm and he found steps. At the top of those, the air was different. Warmer. Dear God, warmer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sit,” said Tom. “Don’t do anything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He sank to the floor, wrapped his arms around his legs, and pressed his face into his arms. Tom was banging around somewhere up front, flicking switches. After a while, Wil began to feel alive. He raised his head. A yellow glow emanated from what he assumed was the cockpit. He massaged his feet. Could you get frostbite that quickly? Because he felt like he had frostbite. He decided to walk around, to save his feet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The cockpit was a cramped nest of instruments, a single seat surrounded by dark panels. Tom was buckled in. “You can fly this?” Wil said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s not brain surgery.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can’t even see where you’re going. It’s pitch-black out there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I will assume we’re currently pointed in the right direction,” Tom said. “And drive straight.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Uh,” Wil said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom ran his thumb across a dial and finished up on a worn black button. “I think we’re good to go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You think?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s been a while since I did this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You said it wasn’t brain surgery.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It isn’t. But the penalty for errors is high.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Maybe we should think about this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom waited. Wil thought he was reconsidering. Then he realized Tom was watching something. He followed his gaze but saw nothing but night sky. One of the stars was moving.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is that?” he said, and realized. “A helicopter.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. Go sit down.” He depressed the button. Something went <em class="calibre1">click</em>. “Hmm.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Was that supposed to happen?” Tom didn’t answer, but clearly no. “Did they sabotage the plane? Do you think they—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Will you shut the fuck up?” Tom murmured to himself, poring over the controls. Ahead, the star grew. The ground beneath it began to twinkle. A searchlight swept snow.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s getting closer.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Get out!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m just letting you—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Get out of the cockpit!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He groped through darkness until he reached seats. He dropped into one and felt for the belt. Nothing happened for a while. He glanced behind him. He could make out shapes back there. Something in the seats. He couldn’t sit still, so he got up and made his way toward them. He found a metal suitcase on one seat, gleaming faintly in the gloom. He slid his hands around it and found clasps.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He couldn’t see, so he explored with his fingers. Something clinked. He felt fabric. He discovered something tubular and tried to pull it but it wouldn’t come. He pulled the case out of the seat and took it toward the front of the plane. When he was close enough to see, he peered into the case. Some of the equipment he didn’t recognize. Some he did. Syringes. Drill bits. In the center, its blade sheathed in plastic, lay a scalpel.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When he entered the cockpit, Tom was lying on his back, buried up to his elbows in the underside of the instrument panel. Wil held out the scalpel. “What is this?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not now, Wil.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Look at this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Tom’s head appeared. His expression did not change. He disappeared beneath the panel again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What were you going to do to me?” He had to raise his voice over the rising thrumming of the chopper. “That guy said you were going to pull my head open. That’s what he said. Pull my head open. And I’m starting to wonder, Tom, whether that was an expression.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Will you fuck off?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Were you going to kill me?</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll kill you now if you don’t get out of here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil moved forward with the scalpel. He wasn’t going to stab Tom. He just wanted to be taken seriously. But Tom’s hand flashed out and grabbed Wil’s wrist and twisted the scalpel from it. He tossed the scalpel into the back of plane, looked at Wil condescendingly, and climbed into the pilot’s seat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil said, “You owe me an answer.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We were going to do whatever was necessary.” Tom flicked a row of switches. “If we could get the word that destroyed Broken Hill from you without requiring us to crack open your head, terrific. We’d go that way. If not, the other. It’s better than what the other side wants for you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It doesn’t fucking sound better.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know Woolf,” Tom said. “I’ve known her since she was a sixteen-year-old girl. Trust me, this is better. Sit the fuck down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Light burst in the windshield. Wil raised his arm. The searchlight had found the plane. Beneath its gaze, the runway looked like black glass. The thrumming overhead was like thunder.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, now I can see.” Tom thumbed the black button. The engines thumped. A low whine of power began to build. Something above Wil’s head went <em class="calibre1">thwack thwack thwack</em>. The plane began to trundle forward.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re shooting at us. Are they shooting at us?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They bumped forward, gaining speed. “You know there’s a chopper up there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So even if we get off the ground, how are we going to get away from the chopper?” The plane’s momentum pressed at him. He seized the back of Tom’s chair. He was going to regret not sitting down. But he wasn’t leaving. “<em class="calibre1">How do we get away from the chopper, Tom?</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Planes are faster than choppers.” Tom pulled on the yoke. They lifted off.</p>
