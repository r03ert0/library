      <h2>In his mind, Julie Mao tilted her head, listening to his...</h2>
      <p>This was why he had searched for her. Julie had become the part of him that was capable of human feeling. The symbol of what he could have been if he hadnâ€™t been this. There was no reason to think his imagined Julie had anything in common with the real woman. Meeting her would have been a disappointment for them both.</p>
      <p>He had to believe that, the same way heâ€™d had to believe everything that had cut him off from love before.</p>
      <p>Holden stopped, the bodyâ€”corpse nowâ€”of Ko tugging Miller back to himself.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Holden nodded at the access panel in front of them. Miller looked at it, uncomprehending, and then recognized it. Theyâ€™d made it. They were back at the hideout.</p>
      <p>â€œAre you all right?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. â€œJust woolgathering. Sorry.â€�</p>
      <p>He dropped Ko, and the thug slid to the floor with a sad thud. Millerâ€™s arm had fallen asleep. He shook it, but the tingling didnâ€™t go away. A wave of vertigo and nausea passed through him. Symptoms, he thought.</p>
      <p>â€œHowâ€™d we do for time?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™re a little past deadline. Five minutes. Itâ€™ll be fine,â€� Holden said, and slid the door open.</p>
      <p>The space beyond, where Naomi and Alex and Amos had been, was empty.</p>
      <p>â€œFuck me,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Chapter Twenty-Nine: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Fuck me,â€� Holden said. And a moment later: â€œThey left us.â€�</p>
      <p>No. She had left him. Naomi had said she would, but confronted with the reality of it, Holden realized that he hadnâ€™t really believed her. But here it wasâ€”the proof. The empty space where she used to be. His heart hammered and his throat tightened, breath coming in gasps. The sick feeling in his gut was either despair or his colon sloughing off its lining. He was going to die sitting outside a cheap hotel on Eros because Naomi had done exactly what sheâ€™d said she would. What he himself had ordered her to do. His resentment refused to listen to reason.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™re dead,â€� he said, and sat down on the edge of a fern-filled planter.</p>
      <p>â€œHow long do we have?â€� Miller asked, looking up and down the corridor while he fidgeted with his gun.</p>
      <p>â€œNo idea,â€� Holden replied, gesturing vaguely at his terminalâ€™s flashing red radiation symbol. â€œHours before we really start to feel it, I think, but I donâ€™t know. God, I wish Shed was still here.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShed?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFriend of mine,â€� Holden said, not feeling up to elaborating. â€œGood med tech.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCall her,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Holden looked at his terminal and tapped the screen a few times.</p>
      <p>â€œNetworkâ€™s still down,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right,â€� Miller said. â€œLetâ€™s go to your ship. See if itâ€™s still in dock.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™ll be gone. Naomiâ€™s keeping the crew alive. She warned me, but Iâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo letâ€™s go anyway,â€� Miller said. He was shifting from one foot to the other and looking down the corridor as he spoke.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller,â€� Holden said, then stopped. Miller was clearly on edge, and heâ€™d shot four people. Holden was increasingly frightened of the former cop. As if reading his mind, Miller stepped close, the two-meter man towering over him where he sat. Miller smiled ruefully, his eyes unnervingly gentle. Holden would almost have preferred they be threatening.</p>
      <p>â€œWay I see it, thereâ€™s three ways this can go,â€� Miller said. â€œOne, we find your ship still in dock, get the meds we need, and maybe we live. Two, we try to get to the ship, and along the way we run into a bunch of mafia thugs. Die gloriously in a hail of bullets. Three, we sit here and leak out of our eyes and assholes.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden said nothing; he just stared up at the cop and frowned.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m liking the first two better than the last one,â€� Miller said. His voice made it sound like an apology. â€œHow about you come with?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden laughed before he could catch himself, but Miller didnâ€™t look like he was taking offense.</p>
      <p>â€œSure,â€� Holden said. â€œI just needed to feel sorry for myself for a minute. Letâ€™s go get killed by the mafia.â€�</p>
      <p>He said it with much more bravado than he felt. The truth was he didnâ€™t want to die. Even during his time in the navy, the idea of dying in the line of duty had always seemed distant and unreal. His ship would never be destroyed, and if it was, he would make it to the escape shuttle. The universe without him in it didnâ€™t make any sense at all. Heâ€™d taken risks; heâ€™d seen other people die. Even people he loved. Now, for the first time, his own death was a real thing.</p>
      <p>He looked at the cop. Heâ€™d known the man less than a day, didnâ€™t trust him, and wasnâ€™t sure he much liked him. And this was who heâ€™d die with. Holden shuddered and stood up, pulling his gun out of his waistband. Under the panic and fear, there was a deep feeling of calm. He hoped it would last.</p>
      <p>â€œAfter you,â€� Holden said. â€œIf we make it, remind me to call my mothers.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The casinos were a powder keg waiting for a match. If the evacuation sweeps had been even moderately successful, there were probably a million or more people crammed into three levels of the station. Hard-looking men in riot gear moved through the crowds, telling everyone to stay put until they were taken to the radiation shelters, keeping the crowd frightened. Every now and then, a small group of citizens would be led away. Knowing where they were going made Holdenâ€™s stomach burn. He wanted to yell out that cops were fake, that they were killing people. But a riot with this many people in such a confined space would be a meat grinder. Maybe that was inevitable but he wasnâ€™t going to be the one to start it.</p>
      <p>Someone else did.</p>
      <p>Holden could hear raised voices, the angry rumble of the mob, followed by the electronically amplified voice of someone in a riot helmet yelling for people to get back. And then a gunshot, a brief pause, then a fusillade. People screamed. The entire crowd around Holden and Miller surged in two opposing directions, some of the people rushing toward the sound of the conflict, but many more of them running away from it. Holden spun in the current of bodies; Miller reached out and grabbed the back of his shirt, gripping it in his fist and yelling for Holden to stay close.</p>
      <p>About a dozen meters down the corridor, in a coffee shop seating area separated by a waist-high black iron fence, one of the mafia thugs had been cut off from his group by a dozen citizens. Gun drawn, he was backing up and yelling at them to move aside. They kept advancing, their faces wild with the drunken frenzy of mob violence.</p>
      <p>The mafia thug fired once, and one small body staggered forward, then fell to the ground at the thugâ€™s feet. Holden couldnâ€™t tell if it was a boy or a girl, but they couldnâ€™t be more than thirteen or fourteen years old. The thug moved forward, looking down at the small thin figure at his feet, and pointed his gun at them again.</p>
      <p>It was too much.</p>
      <p>Holden found himself running down the corridor toward the thug, gun drawn and screaming for people to get out of the way. When he was about seven meters away, the crowd split apart enough for him to begin firing. Half his shots went wild, hitting the coffee shop counter and walls, one round blowing a stack of ceramic plates into the air. But a few of them hit the thug, staggering him back.</p>
      <p>Holden vaulted the waist-high metal fence and came to a sliding halt about three meters from the fake cop and his victim. Holdenâ€™s gun fired one last time and then the slide locked in the open position to let him know it was empty.</p>
      <p>The thug didnâ€™t fall down. He straightened up, looked down at his torso, and then looked up and pointed his gun at Holdenâ€™s face. Holden had time to count the three bullets that were smashed against the heavy chest armor of the thugâ€™s riot gear. Die gloriously in a hail of bullets, he thought.</p>
      <p>The thug said, â€œStupid mother fuâ€”â€� and his head snapped back in a spray of red. He slumped to the floor.</p>
      <p>â€œGap at the neck, remember?â€� Miller said from behind him. â€œChest armorâ€™s too thick for a pistol.â€�</p>
      <p>Suddenly dizzy, Holden bent over at the waist, gasping for air. He tasted lemon at the back of his throat and swallowed twice to stop himself from throwing up. He was afraid it would be full of blood and stomach lining. He didnâ€™t need to see that.</p>
      <p>â€œThanks,â€� he gasped out, turning his head toward Miller.</p>
      <p>Miller just nodded vaguely in his direction, then walked over to the guard and nudged him with one foot. Holden stood up and looked around the corridor, waiting for the inevitable wave of vengeful mafia enforcers to come crashing down on them. He didnâ€™t see any. He and Miller were standing in a quiet island of calm in the midst of Armageddon. All around them, tendrils of violence were whipping into high gear. People were running in every direction; the mafia goons were yelling in booming amplified voices and punctuating the threats with periodic gunfire. But there were only hundreds of them, and there were many thousands of angry and panicked civilians. Miller gestured at the chaos.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is what happens,â€� he said. â€œGive a bunch of yahoos the equipment, and they think they know what theyâ€™re doing.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden crouched beside the fallen child. It was a boy, maybe thirteen, with Asian features and dark hair. His chest had a gaping wound in it, blood trickling out instead of gushing. He didnâ€™t have a pulse that Holden could find. Holden picked him up anyway, looking around for someplace to take him.</p>
      <p>â€œHeâ€™s dead,â€� Miller said as he replaced the cartridge heâ€™d fired.</p>
      <p>â€œGo to hell. We donâ€™t know. If we can get him to the ship, maybeâ€¦ â€�</p>
