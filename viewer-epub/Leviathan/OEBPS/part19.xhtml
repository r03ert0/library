      <h2>â€œAnyone else think this is desperate fucking queer?â€�...</h2>
      <p>The Donnager began to ring like a gong struck over and oveDonr ar again by a massive hammer. Return fire.</p>
      <p>The gauss round that killed Shed didnâ€™t even make a noise. Like a magic trick, two perfectly round holes appeared on either side of the room in a line that intersected Shedâ€™s couch. One moment, the medic was there; the next, his head was gone from the Adamâ€™s apple up. Arterial blood pumped out in a red cloud, pulled into two thin lines, and whirled to the holes in the walls of the room as the air rushed out.</p>
      <p>Chapter Twelve: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>For twelve years, Miller had worked security. Violence and death were familiar companions to him. Men, women. Animals. Kids. Once heâ€™d held a womanâ€™s hand while she bled to death. Heâ€™d killed two people, could still see them die if he closed his eyes and thought about it. If anyone had asked him, heâ€™d have said there wasnâ€™t much left that would shake him.</p>
      <p>But heâ€™d never watched a war start before.</p>
      <p>The Distinguished Hyacinth Lounge was in the shift-change rush. Men and women in security uniformsâ€”mostly from Star Helix, but a few smaller companies tooâ€”were either drinking their after-work liquor and winding down or making trips to the breakfast buffet for coffee, textured fungi in sugar sauce, sausage with meat maybe one part in a thousand. Miller chewed the sausage and watched the display monitor on the wall. A Star Helix external relations head looked sincerely out, his demeanor radiating calm and certainty as he explained how everything was going to hell.</p>
      <p>â€œPreliminary scans suggest that the explosion was the result of a failed attempt to connect a nuclear device to the docking station. Officials from the Martian government have referred to the incident only as an â€˜alleged terrorist actionâ€™ and refused comment pending further investigation.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnother one,â€� Havelock said from behind him. â€œYou know, eventually, one of those assholes is going to get it right.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller turned in his seat, then nodded to the chair beside him. Havelock sat.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™ll be an interesting day,â€� Miller said. â€œI was about to call you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, sorry,â€� his partner said. â€œI was up kind of late.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAny word on the transfer?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Havelock said. â€œFigure my paperworkâ€™s hung on a desk someplace in Olympus. What about you? Any word on your special-project girl?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot yet,â€� Miller said. â€œLook, the reason I wanted to meet up before we went inâ€¦ I need to take a couple days, try to run down some leads on Julie. With all this other shit going on, Shaddid doesnâ€™t want me doing much more than phoning this one in.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBut youâ€™re ignoring that,â€� Havelock said. It wasnâ€™t a question.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve got a feeling about this one.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo how can I help?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI need you to cover for me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow am I going to do that?â€� Havelock asked. â€œItâ€™s not like I can tell them youâ€™re sick. Theyâ€™ve got access to your medical records same as everyone elseâ€™s.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTell â€™em Iâ€™ve been getting drunk a lot,â€� Miller said. â€œThat Candace came by. Sheâ€™s my ex-wife.â€�</p>
      <p>Havelock chewed his sausage, brow furrowed. The Earther shook his head slowlyâ€”not a refusal, but the prelude to a question. Miller waited.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re telling me youâ€™d rather have the boss think youâ€™re missing work because youâ€™re on a dysfunctional, heartbroken bender than that youâ€™re doing the work she assigned you? I donâ€™t get it.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller licked his lips and leaned forward, elbows on the smooth off-white table. Someone had scratched a design into the plastic. A split circle. And this was a cop bar.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking at,â€� Miller said. â€œThereâ€™s a bunch of things that belong together somehow, and Iâ€™m not sure yet what it is. Until I know more, I need to stay low. A guy has a fling with his ex, hits the bottle for a few days? Thatâ€™s not going to light up anyoneâ€™s panels.â€�</p>
      <p>Havelock shook his head again, this time in mild disbelief. If heâ€™d been a Belter, heâ€™d have made the gesture with his hands, so you could see it when he had an environment suit on. Another of the hundred small ways someone who hadnâ€™t grown up on the Belt betrayed himself. The wall monitor cut to the image of a blond woman in a severe uniform. The external relations head was talking about the Martian navyâ€™s tactical response and whether the OPA was behind the increased vandalism. That was what he called fumbling an overloaded fusion reactor while setting up a ship-killing booby trap: vandalism.</p>
      <p>â€œThat shit just doesnâ€™t follow,â€� Havelock said, and for a moment Miller didnâ€™t know if he meant the Belter guerrilla actions, the Martian response, or the favor heâ€™d asked. â€œSeriously. Whereâ€™s Earth? All this shitâ€™s going on, and we donâ€™t hear a damn thing from them.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy would we?â€� Miller asked. â€œItâ€™s Mars and the Belt going at it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhen was the last time Earth let anything major happen without them in the middle of it?â€� Havelock said, then sighed. â€œOkay. Youâ€™re too drunk to come in. Your love lifeâ€™s a mess. Iâ€™m trying to cover for you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJust for a couple days.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMake sure you get back before someone decides itâ€™s the perfect chance for a random shooting to take out the Earther cop.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll do that,â€� Miller said, rising from the table. â€œYou watch your back.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t need to tell me twice,â€� Havelock said.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The Ceres Center for Jiu Jitsu was down near the port, where the spin gravity was strongest. The hole was a converted storage space from before the big spin. A cylinder flattened where flooring had been set in about a third of the way from the bottom. Racks bearing various lengths of staffs, bamboo swords, and dull plastic practice knives hung from the vaulted ceiling. The polished stone echoed with the grunting of men working a line of resistance machines and the soft thud of a woman at the back punishing a heavy bag. Three students stood on the central mat, speaking in low voices.</p>
      <p>Pictures filled the front wall on either side of the door. Soldiers in uniform. Security agents for half a dozen Belter corporations. Not many inner planet types, but a few. Plaques commemorating placements in competitions. A page of small type outlining the history of the studio.</p>
      <p>One of the students shouted and collapsed, carrying ojustifarrne of the others to the mat with her. The one still standing applauded and helped them back up. Miller searched through the wall of pictures, hoping to find Julie.</p>
      <p>â€œCan I help you?â€�</p>
      <p>The man was half a head shorter than Miller and easily twice as broad. It should have made him look like an Earther, but everything else about him said Belt. He wore pale sweats that made his skin seem even darker. His smile was curious and as serene as a well-fed predator. Miller nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œDetective Miller,â€� he said. â€œIâ€™m with station security. Thereâ€™s one of your students I wanted to get some background on.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThis is an official investigation?â€� the man asked.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. â€œIâ€™m afraid it is.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThen youâ€™ll have a warrant.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller smiled. The man smiled back.</p>
      <p>â€œWe donâ€™t give out any information on our students without a warrant,â€� he said. â€œStudio policy.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI respect that,â€� Miller said. â€œNo, I really do. Itâ€™s just thatâ€¦ parts of this particular investigation are maybe a little more official than others. The girlâ€™s not in trouble. She didnâ€™t do anything. But she has family on Luna who want her found.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œA kidnap job,â€� the man said, folding his arms. The serene face had gone cool without any apparent movement.</p>
      <p>â€œOnly the official part,â€� Miller said. â€œI can get a warrant, and we can do the whole thing through channels. But then I have to tell my boss. The more she knows, the less room I have to move.â€�</p>
      <p>The man didnâ€™t react. His stillness was unnerving. Miller struggled not to fidget. The woman working the heavy bag at the far end of the studio went through a flurry of strikes, shouting out with each one.</p>
      <p>â€œWho?â€� the man asked.</p>
      <p>â€œJulie Mao,â€� Miller said. He could have said he was looking for the Buddhaâ€™s mother for all the reaction he got. â€œI think sheâ€™s in trouble.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy do you care if she is?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know the answer to that one,â€� Miller said. â€œI just do. If you donâ€™t want to help me, then you donâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd youâ€™ll go get your warrant. Do this through channels.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller took off his hat, rubbed a long, thin hand across his head, and put the hat back in place.</p>
      <p>â€œProbably not,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œLet me see your ID,â€� the man said. Miller pulled up his terminal and let the man confirm who he was. The man handed it back and pointed to a small door behind the heavy bags. Miller did as he was told.</p>
      <p>The office was cramped. A small laminate desk with a soft sphere behind it in lieu of a chair. Two stools that looked like theyâ€™d come out of a bar. A filing cabinet with a small fabricator that stank of ozone and oil that was probably where the plaques and certificates were made.</p>
      <p>â€œWhy does the family want her?â€� the man asked, lowering himself onto the sphere. It acted like a chair but required constant balance. A place to rest without actually resting.</p>
      <p>â€œThey think sheâ€™s in harmâ€™s way. At least, thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re saying, and I donâ€™t have reason to disbelieve them yet.€™re stheâ€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat kind of harm?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t know,â€� Miller said. â€œI know she was on station. I know she shipped out for Tycho, and after that, Iâ€™ve got nothing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHer family want her back on their station?â€�</p>
      <p>The man knew who her family was. Miller filed the information away without missing a beat.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€� Miller said. â€œThe last message she got from them routed through Luna.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDown the well.â€� The way he said it made it sound like a disease.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m looking for anyone who knows who she was shipping with. If sheâ€™s on a run, where she was going and when she was planning to get there. If sheâ€™s in range of a tightbeam.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know any of that,â€� the man said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou know anyone I should ask?â€�</p>
      <p>There was a pause.</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe. Iâ€™ll find what I can for you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnything else you can tell me about her?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe started at the studio five years ago. She wasâ€¦ angry when she first came. Undisciplined.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe got better,â€� Miller said. â€œBrown belt, right?â€�</p>
      <p>The manâ€™s eyebrows rose.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m a cop,â€� Miller said. â€œI find things out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe improved,â€� her teacher said. â€œSheâ€™d been attacked. Just after she came to the Belt. She was seeing that it didnâ€™t happen twice.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAttacked,â€� Miller said, parsing the manâ€™s tone of voice. â€œRaped?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI didnâ€™t ask. She trained hard, even when she was off station. You can tell when people let it slide. They come back weaker. She never did.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTough girl,â€� Miller said. â€œGood for her. Did she have friends? People she sparred with?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œA few. No lovers that I know of, since thatâ€™s the next question.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s strange. Girl like that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLike what, Detective?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPretty girl,â€� Miller said. â€œCompetent. Smart. Dedicated. Who wouldnâ€™t want to be with someone like that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPerhaps she hadnâ€™t met the right person.â€�</p>
      <p>Something in the way he said it hinted at amusement. Miller shrugged, uncomfortable in his skin.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat kind of work did she do?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œLight freighter. I donâ€™t know of any particular cargo. I had the impression that she shipped wherever there was a need.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot a regular route, then?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat was my impression.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhose ships did she work? One particular freighter, or whatever came to hand? A particular company?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll find what I can for you,â€� the man said.</p>
      <p>â€œCourier for the OPA?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll find out,â€� the man said, â€œwhat I can.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The news that afternoon was all about Phoebe. The science station thereâ€”the one that Belters werenâ€™t allowed even to dock atâ€”had been hit. The official report stated that half the inhabitants of the base were dead, the other half missing. No one had claimed responsibility yet, but the common wisdom was that some Belter groupâ€”maybe the OPA, maybe someone elseâ€”had finally managed an act of â€œvandalismâ€� with a body count. Miller sat in his hole, watching the broadcast feed and drinking.</p>
      <p>It was all going to hell. The pirate casts from the OPA calling for war. The burgeoning guerrilla actions. All of it. The time was coming that Mars wasnâ€™t going to ignore them anymore. And when Mars took action, it wouldnâ€™t matter if Earth followed suit. It would be the first real war in the Belt. The catastrophe was coming, and neither side seemed to understand how vulnerable they were. And there was nothingâ€”not one single goddamned thingâ€”that he could do to stop it. He couldnâ€™t even slow it down.</p>
      <p>Julie Mao grinned at him from the still frame, her pinnace behind her. Attacked, the man had said. There was nothing about it in her record. Might have been a mugging. Might have been something worse. Miller had known a lot of victims, and he put them into three categories. First there were the ones who pretended nothing had happened, or that whatever it was didnâ€™t really matter. That was well over half the people he talked to. Then there were the professionals, people who took their victimization as permission to act out any way they saw fit. That ate most of the rest.</p>
      <p>Maybe 5 percent, maybe less, were the ones who sucked it up, learned the lesson, and moved on. The Julies. The good ones.</p>
      <p>His door chimed three hours after his official shift was over. Miller stood up, less steady on his feet than heâ€™d expected. He counted the bottles on the table. There were more than heâ€™d thought. He hesitated for a moment, torn between answering the door and throwing the bottles into the recycler. The door chimed again. He went to open it. If it was someone from the station, they expected him to be drunk, anyway. No reason to disappoint.</p>
      <p>The face was familiar. Acne-pocked, controlled. The OPA armband from the bar. The one whoâ€™d had Mateo Judd killed.</p>
      <p>The cop.</p>
      <p>â€œEvening,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œDetective Miller,â€� the pocked man said. â€œI think weâ€™ve gotten off on the wrong foot. I was hoping we could try again.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRight.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMay I come in?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI try not to take strange men home,â€� Miller said. â€œI donâ€™t even know your name.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnderson Dawes,â€� the pocked man said. â€œIâ€™m the Ceres liaison for the Outer Planets Alliance. I think we can help each other. May I come in?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller stood back, and the pocked manâ€”Dawesâ€”stepped inside. Dawes took in the hole for the space of two slow breaths, then sat as if the bottles and the stink of old beer were nothing to comment on. Silently cursing himself and willing a sobriety he didnâ€™t feel, Miller sat across from him.</p>
      <p>â€œI need a favor from you,â€� Dawes said. â€œIâ€™m willing to pay for it. Not money, of course. Information.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat do you want?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œSler asifytop looking for Juliette Mao.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo sale.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m trying to keep the peace, Detective,â€� Dawes said. â€œYou should hear me out.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller leaned forward, elbows on the table. Mr. Serene Jiu Jitsu Instructor was working for the OPA? The timing of Dawesâ€™ visit seemed to be saying so. Miller filed that possibility away but said nothing.</p>
      <p>â€œMao worked for us,â€� Dawes said. â€œBut youâ€™d guessed that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMore or less. You know where she is?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe donâ€™t. We are looking for her. And we need to be the ones to find her. Not you.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shook his head. There was a response, the right thing to say. It was rattling in the back of his head, and if he just didnâ€™t feel quite so fuzzyâ€¦</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re one of them, Detective. You may have lived your whole life out here, but your salary is paid by an inner planet corporation. No, wait. I donâ€™t blame you. I understand how it is. They were hiring and you needed the work. Butâ€¦ weâ€™re walking on a bubble right now. The Canterbury. The fringe elements in the Belt calling for war.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPhoebe Station.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes, theyâ€™ll blame us for that too. Add a Luna corporationâ€™s prodigal daughterâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou think somethingâ€™s happened to her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe was on the Scopuli,â€� Dawes said, and when Miller didnâ€™t immediately respond, he added, â€œThe freighter that Mars used as bait when they killed the Canterbury.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller thought about that for a long moment, then whistled low.</p>
      <p>â€œWe donâ€™t know what happened,â€� Dawes said. â€œUntil we do, I canâ€™t have you stirring up the water. Itâ€™s muddy enough now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd what information are you offering?â€� Miller asked. â€œThatâ€™s the trade, right?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll tell you what we find. After we find her,â€� Dawes said. Miller chuckled, and the OPA man went on. â€œItâ€™s a generous offer, considering who you are. Employee of Mars. Partner of an Earther. Some people would think that was enough to make you the enemy too.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBut not you,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œI think weâ€™ve got the same basic goals, you and I. Stability. Safety. Strange times make for strange alliances.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTwo questions.â€�</p>
      <p>Dawes spread his arms, welcoming them.</p>
      <p>â€œWho took the riot gear?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œRiot gear?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBefore the Canterbury died, someone took our riot gear. Maybe they wanted to arm soldiers for crowd control. Maybe they didnâ€™t want our crowds controlled. Who took it? Why?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt wasnâ€™t us,â€� Dawes said.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s not an answer. Try this one. What happened to the Golden Bough Society?â€�</p>
      <p>Dawes looked blank.</p>
      <p>â€œLoca Greiga?â€� Miller asked. â€œSohiro?â€�</p>
      <p>Dawes opened his mouth, closed it. Miller dropped his beer bottle into the recycler.</p>
      <p>â€œNothing person></p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not a fair test,â€� Dawes said. â€œGive me a few days, Iâ€™ll get answers for you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTalk to me then. Iâ€™ll try not to start an all-out war while you do, but Iâ€™m not letting go of Julie. You can go now.â€�</p>
      <p>Dawes rose. He looked sour.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re making a mistake,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œWonâ€™t be my first.â€�</p>
      <p>After the man left, Miller sat at his table. Heâ€™d been stupid. Worse, heâ€™d been self-indulgent. Drinking himself into a stupor instead of doing the work. Instead of finding Julie. But he knew more now. The Scopuli. The Canterbury. More lines between the dots.</p>
      <p>He cleaned away his bottles, took a shower, and pulled up his terminal, searching what there was about Julieâ€™s ship. After an hour, a new thought occurred to him, a small fear that grew the more he looked at it. Near midnight, he put a call through to Havelockâ€™s hole.</p>
      <p>His partner took two full minutes to answer. When he did, his image was wild-haired and bleary-eyed.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHavelock. You have any vacation time saved up?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œA little.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSick leave?â€�</p>
