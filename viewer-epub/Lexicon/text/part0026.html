			<p class="Book-Entry-Text-FL">In the Dreaming the land was flat. There were no gorges and no hills, and no rivers. The animals lived in one tribe and spoke with one tongue, so they could understand one another.</p>
			<p class="Book-Entry-Text">One day Tajura, the Rainbow Serpent, carved his name in the bark of a coolabah tree. He said to the other animals, “Look what I have done, I have written my name on this tree, so you must do what I say.”</p>
			<p class="Book-Entry-Text">The animals were impressed and did as Tajura said. They offered their food and made him a great shelter. They brought dirt from the land together and put it beneath the coolabah tree so that it was raised up, so they could admire Tajura’s name, and that was the first hill.</p>
			<p class="Book-Entry-Text">But Borah, the kangaroo, was not impressed. “Why should we give Tajura our food, our best bark, and work for him?” he asked. He climbed the hill and tore the bark from the coolabah tree where it spoke Tajura’s name and buried it in the ground.</p>
			<p class="Book-Entry-Text">The animals were ashamed and said, “We shall speak in our own tongue, so we will not be impressed by Tajura’s words.” They went away, some north, some east, some west, some south, and that is why today the dingo howls, the frog croaks, the cockatoo screeches, and none can understand the other.</p>
