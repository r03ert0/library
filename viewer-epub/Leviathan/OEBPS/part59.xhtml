      <h2>If heâ€™d done the math right, the Nauvooâ€™s impact site...</h2>
      <p>The massive glow of the Nauvoo filled a quarter of the sky now, and the full circle of it was free of the horizon. The Eros feedâ€™s soft murmur shifted to something more clearly synthetic: a rising, spiraling sound that reminded him for no particular reason of the green sweeping radar screens of ancient films. There were voices at the back of it, but he couldnâ€™t make out the words or even the language.</p>
      <p>The great torch of the Nauvoo was a full half of the sky, the stars around it blotted out by the light of full burn. Millerâ€™s suit chirped a radiation warning and he shut it off.</p>
      <p>A manned Nauvoo would never have sustained a burn like that; even in the best couch, the thrust gravity would have pulped bones. He tried to guess how fast the ship would be going when it hit.</p>
      <p>Fast enough. That was all that mattered. Fast enough.</p>
      <p>There, in the center of the fiery bloom, Miller saw a dark spot, no more than the dot of a pencilâ€™s tip. The ship itself. He took a deep breath. When he closed his eyes, the light pressed red through his lids. When he opened them again, the Nauvoo had length. Shape. It was a needle, an arrow, a missile. A fist rising from the depths. For the first time in memory, Miller felt awe.</p>
      <p>Eros shouted.</p>
      <p>â€œDONâ€™T YOU FUCKING TOUCH ME!â€�</p>
      <p>Slowly, the bloom of engine fire changed from a circle to an oval to a great feathery plume, the Nauvoo itself showing silver in rough profile. Miller gaped.</p>
      <p>The Nauvoo had missed. It had turned. It was right now, right now, speeding past Eros and not into it. But he hadnâ€™t seen any kind of maneuvering rockets fire. And how would you turn something that big, moving that quickly, so abruptly that it would veer off between one breath and the next without also tearing the ship apart? The acceleration g aloneâ€¦</p>
      <p>Miller looked at the stars as if there was some answer written in them. And to his surprise, there was. The sweep of the Milky Way, the infinite scattering of stars were still there. But the angles had changed. The rotation of Eros had shifted. Its relation to the plane of the ecliptic.</p>
      <p>For the Nauvoo to change course at the last minute without falling apart would have been imposing ap> T imposisible. And so it hadnâ€™t happened. Eros was roughly six hundred cubic kilometers. Before Protogen, it had housed the second-largest active port in the Belt.</p>
      <p>And without so much as overcoming the grip of Millerâ€™s magnetic boots, Eros Station had dodged.</p>
      <p>Chapter Forty-Nine: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Holy shit,â€� said Amos in a flat voice.</p>
      <p>â€œJim,â€� Naomi said to Holdenâ€™s back, but he waved her off and opened a channel to Alex in the cockpit.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex, did we just see what my sensors say we saw?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, Cap,â€� the pilot replied. â€œRadar and scopes are both sayinâ€™ Eros jumped two hundred klicks spinward in a little less than a minute.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHoly shit,â€� Amos repeated in exactly the same emotionless tone. The metallic bang of deck hatches opening and closing echoed through the ship, signaling Amosâ€™ approach up the crew ladder.</p>
      <p>Holden shook off the flush of irritation he felt at Amosâ€™ leaving his post. Heâ€™d deal with that later. He needed to be sure that the Rocinante and her crew hadnâ€™t just experienced a group hallucination.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi, give me comms,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Naomi turned around in her chair to face him, her face ashen.</p>
      <p>â€œHow can you be so calm?â€� she asked.</p>
      <p>â€œPanic wonâ€™t help. We need to know whatâ€™s going on before we can plan intelligently. Please transfer the comms to me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHoly shit,â€� Amos said as he climbed into the ops deck. The deck hatch shut with a punctuating bang.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t remember ordering you to leave your post, sailor,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œPlan intelligently,â€� Naomi said like they were words in a foreign language that she almost understood. â€œPlan intelligently.â€�</p>
      <p>Amos threw himself at a chair hard enough that the cushioning gel grabbed him and kept him from bouncing off.</p>
      <p>â€œEros is really fucking big,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œPlan intelligently,â€� Naomi repeated, speaking to herself now.</p>
      <p>â€œI mean, really fucking big,â€� Amos said. â€œDo you know how much energy it took to spin that rock up? I mean, it took years to do that shit.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden put his headset on to drown Amos and Naomi out, and called up Alex again.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex, is Eros still changing velocity?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, Cap. Just sitting there like a rock.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden said. â€œAmos and Naomi are vapor locked. How are you doing?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot taking my hands off the stick while that bastard is anywhere in my space, thatâ€™s for damn sure.â€�</p>
      <p>Thank God for military training, Holden thought.</p>
      <p>â€œGood, keep us at a constant distance of five thousand klicks until I say otherwise. Let me know if it moves again, even an inch.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that, Cap,â€� said Alex.</p>
      <p>Holden took off his =“justt” …headset and turned to face the rest of the crew. Amos was looking at the ceiling, ticking points off with his fingers, his eyes unfocused.</p>
      <p>â€œâ€”donâ€™t really remember the mass of Eros off the top of my headâ€¦ â€� he was saying to no one in particular.</p>
      <p>â€œAbout seven thousand trillion kilos,â€� Naomi replied. â€œGive or take. And the heat signatureâ€™s up about two degrees.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJesus,â€� the mechanic said. â€œI canâ€™t do that math in my head. That much mass coming up two degrees like that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œA lot,â€� Holden said. â€œSo letâ€™s move onâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAbout ten exajoules,â€� Naomi said. â€œThatâ€™s just off the top of my head, but Iâ€™m not off by an order of magnitude or anything.â€�</p>
      <p>Amos whistled.</p>
      <p>â€œTen exajoules is like, what, a two-gigaton fusion bomb?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s about a hundred kilos converted directly to energy,â€� Naomi said. Her voice began to steady. â€œWhich, of course, we couldnâ€™t do. But at least whatever they did wasnâ€™t magic.â€�</p>
      <p>Holdenâ€™s mind grabbed on to her words with an almost physical sensation. Naomi was, in fact, about the smartest person he knew. She had just spoken directly to the half-articulated fear heâ€™d been harboring since Eros had jumped sideways: that this was magic, that the protomolecule didnâ€™t have to obey the laws of physics. Because if that was true, humans didnâ€™t stand a chance.</p>
      <p>â€œExplain,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œWell,â€� she replied, tapping on her keypad. â€œHeating Eros up didnâ€™t move it. So I assume that means it was waste heat from whatever it was they actually did.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd that means?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat entropy still exists. That they canâ€™t convert mass to energy with perfect efficiency. That their machines or processes or whatever they use to move seven thousand trillion tons of rock wastes some energy. About a two-gigaton bombâ€™s worth of it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAh.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou couldnâ€™t move Eros two hundred kilometers with a two-gigaton bomb,â€� Amos said with a snort.</p>
      <p>â€œNo, you couldnâ€™t,â€� Naomi replied. â€œThis is just the leftovers. Heat by-product. Their efficiency is still off the charts, but it isnâ€™t perfect. Which means the laws of physics still hold. Which means it isnâ€™t magic.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMight as well be,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>Naomi looked at Holden.</p>
      <p>â€œSo, weâ€”â€� he started when Alex interrupted over the shipwide comm.</p>
      <p>â€œCap, Eros is movinâ€™ again.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFollow it, get me a course and speed as soon as you can,â€� Holden said, turning back to his console. â€œAmos, get back down to engineering. If you leave it again without a direct order, Iâ€™ll have the XO beat you to death with a pipe wrench.â€�</p>
      <p>The only reply was the hiss of the deck hatch opening and the bang as it closed behind the descending mechanic.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex,â€� Holden said, staring at the data stream the Rocinante was feeding him about Eros. â€œTell me something.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSunward is all we know for sure,â€� Alex replied, his voice still calm and professional. When Holden had been in the military, heân th� cory, heân€™d been officer track right from the start. Heâ€™d never been to military pilot school, but he knew that years of training had compartmentalized Alexâ€™s brain into two halves: piloting problems and, secondarily, everything else. Matching Eros and getting a course for it was the former. Extra-solar space aliens trying to destroy humanity wasnâ€™t a piloting issue and could be safely ignored until he left the cockpit. He might have a nervous breakdown afterward, but until then, Alex would keep doing his job.</p>
      <p>â€œDrop back to fifty thousand klicks and maintain a constant distance,â€� Holden told him.</p>
      <p>â€œHuh,â€� said Alex. â€œMaintaininâ€™ a constant distance might be tough, Cap. Eros just disappeared off the radar.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden felt his throat go tight.</p>
      <p>â€œSay again?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEros just disappeared off the radar,â€� Alex was saying, but Holden was already punching up the sensor suite to check for himself. His telescopes showed the rock still moving on its new course toward the sun. Thermal imaging showed it as slightly warmer than space. The weird feed of voices and madness that had been leaking out of the station was still detectable, if faint. But radar said there was nothing there.</p>
      <p>Magic, a small voice at the back of his mind said again.</p>
      <p>No, not magic. Humans had stealth ships too. It was just a matter of absorbing the radarâ€™s energy rather than reflecting it. But suddenly, keeping the asteroid in visual range became all the more important. Eros had shown that it could move fast and maneuver wildly, and it was now invisible to radar. It was entirely possible that a mountain-sized rock could disappear completely.</p>
      <p>Gravity began to pile up as the Roci chased Eros toward the sun.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi?â€�</p>
      <p>She looked up at him. The fear was still in her eyes, but she was holding it together. For now.</p>
      <p>â€œJim?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe comm? Could youâ€¦?â€�</p>
      <p>The chagrin on her face was the most reassuring thing heâ€™d seen in hours. She shifted control to his station, and he opened a connection request.</p>
      <p>â€œUNN corvette, this is the Rocinante, please respond.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGo ahead, Rocinante,â€� the other ship said after half a minute of static.</p>
      <p>â€œCalling to confirm our sensor data,â€� Holden said, then transmitted the data regarding Erosâ€™ movement. â€œYou guys seeing the same thing?â€�</p>
      <p>Another delay, this one longer.</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that, Rocinante.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI know we were just about to shoot each other and all, but I think weâ€™re a little past that now,â€� Holden said. â€œAnyway, weâ€™re chasing the rock. If we lose sight of it, we might never find it again. Want to come with? Might be nice to have some backup if it decides to shoot at us or something.â€�</p>
      <p>Another delay, this one almost two minutes long; then a different voice came on the line. Older, female, and totally lacking the arrogance and anger of the young male voice heâ€™d been dealing with so far.</p>
      <p>â€œRocinante, this is Captain McBride of the UNN Escort Vessel Ravi.â€� Ah, thought Holden. Iâ€™ve been talking to the first officer all along. The captain finally took the horn. That might bely tooe, â€œIâ€™ve sent word to fleet command, but itâ€™s a twenty-three minute lag right now, and that rockâ€™s putting on speed. You have a plan?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot really, Ravi. Just follow and gather intel until we find an opportunity to do something that makes a difference. But if you came along, maybe none of your people will shoot at us accidentally while we figure it out.â€�</p>
      <p>There was a long pause. Holden knew that the captain of the Ravi was weighing the chance that he was telling the truth against the threat heâ€™d made against their science vessel. What if he was in on whatever was happening? Heâ€™d be wondering the same thing in their position.</p>
      <p>â€œLook,â€� he said. â€œIâ€™ve told you my name. James Holden. I served as a lieutenant in the UNN. My records should be on file. Itâ€™ll show a dishonorable discharge, but theyâ€™ll also show that my family lives in Montana. I donâ€™t want that rock to hit Earth any more than you do.â€�</p>
      <p>The silence on the other end continued for another few minutes.</p>
      <p>â€œCaptain,â€� she said, â€œI believe my superiors would want me to keep an eye on you. Weâ€™ll be coming along for the ride while the brains figure this out.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden let out a long, noisy exhale.</p>
      <p>â€œThanks for that, McBride. Keep trying to get your people on the line. Iâ€™m going to make a few calls myself. Two corvettes are not going to fix this problem.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that,â€� the Ravi replied, then killed the connection.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve opened a connection with Tycho,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>Holden leaned back in his chair, the mounting gravity of their acceleration pressing against him. A watery lump was gathering low in his gut, the loose knot telling him that he had no idea what he was doing, that all the best plans had failed, and that the end was near. The brief hope heâ€™d felt was already starting to slip away.</p>
      <p>How can you be so calm?</p>
      <p>I think Iâ€™m watching the end of the human race, Holden thought. Iâ€™m calling Fred so that it isnâ€™t my fault when no one has an idea how to stop it. Of course Iâ€™m not calm.</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m just spreading the guilt.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œHow fast?â€� Fred Johnson asked incredulously.</p>
      <p>â€œFour gâ€™s now and climbing,â€� Holden replied, his voice thick as his throat compressed. â€œOh, and itâ€™s invisible to radar now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFour g. Do you know how heavy Eros is?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s, uh, been some discussion,â€� Holden said, only the acceleration keeping his impatience from showing in his voice. â€œThe question is, now what? The Nauvoo missed. Our plans are shot to shit.â€�</p>
      <p>There was another perceptible increase in pressure as Alex sped the ship up to keep up with Eros. A little while longer and speech wouldnâ€™t be possible.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s definitely headed for Earth?â€� Fred asked.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex and Naomi are ninety percent or so. Hard to be totally accurate when we can only use visual data. But I trust them. Iâ€™d go to where there are thirty billion new hosts too.â€�</p>
      <p>Thirty billion new hosts. Eight of whom were his parents. He imagined Father Tom as a bundle of tubes oozing brown goo. Mother Elise as a rib cage dragging itself across the floor with one skeletal arm. And with that much biomass, what could it do then? Move Earth? Turn out the sun?</p>
      <p>â€œHave to warn them,â€� Holden said, trying not to strangle on his own tongue as he spoke.</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t think they know?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey see a threat. They may not see the end of all native life in the solar system,â€� Holden said. â€œYou wanted a reason to sit at the table? How about this one: Come together or die.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred was quiet for a moment. Background radiation spoke to Holden in mystic whispers full of dire portents while he waited. Newcomer, it said. Hang around for fourteen billion years or so. See what Iâ€™ve seen. Then all this nonsense wonâ€™t seem so important.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll see what I can do,â€� Fred said, interrupting the universeâ€™s lecture on transience. â€œIn the meantime, what are you going to do?â€�</p>
