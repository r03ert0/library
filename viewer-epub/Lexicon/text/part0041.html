			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-First">D.C. Mayor Frank Viletti has for the first time ruled out the city compensating residents for losses incurred as a result of last month’s two-day terrorism lockdown.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">“We’re very sympathetic to the residents and business owners inconvenienced, and we are doing and have done everything in our power to allow them to return to their normal lives as quickly as possible,” he said at a press conference today. “However, with an incident like this that affects us all, we feel D.C. residents need to pull together and accept that some shared burden is inevitable.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The remarks seem to signal that the fight for payouts will not be resolved outside the courts. Law firm Vignotti &amp; Busch, which controls the class action, could not be reached for comment.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">During the conference, Mayor Viletti again denied early reports that the lockdown was sparked by the use of a chemical or biological weapon. “There was never any suggestion of that. What we had was forewarning of an imminent attack, and we took action to prevent it.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">He was unable to provide further details, referring questions to the White House. Yesterday, White House spokesperson Gary Fielding reiterated that several people had been arrested during the operation, but that no further information could yet be released.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-Last">“What I will say is that we had a situation and our people responded brilliantly. We should all be proud of what our people did in D.C. last month.”</p>
