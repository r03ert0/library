			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">He rose at four and pulled on his pants and boots and jacket. The house was cold as glass and he tried to coax life out of the remnants of the fireplace but there was nothing there. He tucked his hands into his armpits and went outside. The air was frigid, the sky an open box with no real hint of sunlight yet, and he traipsed through the near paddock to the barn. The cow, Hong, heard his approach and mooed hopefully. He led her inside, positioned the bucket, and took his place on the stool. He massaged milk from her teats, resting his forehead against her side for the warmth. He fell asleep like this sometimes, slipping into dreams of death and words. Then Hong would take a step or two away, jerking him awake.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Filling the bucket took eight minutes. It had seemed ridiculously slow at first. He’d craved greater efficiency. But it was a good lesson in reconnecting. He now enjoyed it as a chance to exist in the moment. There was no past or future when you milked a cow. You were just milking.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He carried the bucket back to the house and transferred its contents to six bottles. The cat curled around his boots, purring like a tractor, and he gave her a little, too. He built a little tepee of sticks and newspaper and lit the fire. By then the first rays were creeping along the tree line, and he paused to watch. The best thing about this house was the view. He could walk around it and see forty miles in every direction. If a car was approaching, he would know thirty minutes before it arrived. The sky was wide and empty. It was a good house.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He heard bare feet on floorboards and Emily emerged, her eyes full of sleep, her cotton nightdress running down from her shoulders.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You should be sleeping,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can’t tell me what to do.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No,” he said. “You have that backward.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She came to him. They kissed. The fire crackled. She tucked herself against him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Want to watch the sun come up?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He grabbed two blankets from the pile and threw one over the bench seat he’d built on the veranda. He put an arm around her and threw the other blanket over them. She rested her head on his shoulder. The sun freed itself from the tree line and he felt its warmth on his face.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I love you,” she said. She nestled closer, her hand moving up the back of his neck. The wind lifted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t kill me,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not going to,” she said.</p>
