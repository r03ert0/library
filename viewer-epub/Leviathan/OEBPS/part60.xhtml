      <h2>Get outrun by a rock and then watch the cradle of humanity...</h2>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m open to suggestions,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe you could detonate some of the surface nukes the demo team put down. Deflect Erosâ€™ course. Buy us time.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™re on proximity fuses. Canâ€™t set them off,â€� Holden said, the last word turning into a yelp as his chair stabbed him in a dozen different places and injected him full of fire. Alex had hit them with the juice, which meant Eros was still speeding up, and he was worried theyâ€™d all black out. How fast was it going to go? Even on the juice they couldnâ€™t sustain prolonged acceleration past seven or eight g without serious risk. If Eros kept this rate of increase up, it would outrun them.</p>
      <p>â€œYou can remote detonate,â€� Fred said. â€œMiller will have the codes. Have the demo team calculate which ones to set off for maximum effect.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that,â€� Holden said. â€œIâ€™ll give Miller a call.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll work on the inners,â€� Fred said, using the Belter slang without a hint of self-consciousness. â€œSee what I can do.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden broke the connection, then linked up to Millerâ€™s ship.</p>
      <p>â€œYo,â€� said whoever was manning the radio there.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is Holden, on the Rocinante. Give me Miller.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUhâ€¦ â€� said the voice. â€œOkay.â€�</p>
      <p>There was a click, then static, then Miller saying hello with a faint echo. Still wearing his helmet, then.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller, this is Holden. We need to talk about what just happened.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEros moved.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller sounded strange, his voice distant, as though he was only barely paying attention to the conversation. Holden felt a flush of irritation but tamped it back down. He needed Miller right now, whether he wanted to or not.</p>
      <p>â€œLook,â€� he said. â€œIâ€™ve talked to Fred and he wants us to coordinate with your demo guys. Youâ€™ve got remote codes. If we set off all of them on one side, we can deflect its course. Get your techs on the line, and weâ€™ll work it out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHuh, yeah, that sounds like a good ideah, tht" od ideaa. Iâ€™ll send the codes along,â€� said Miller, his voice no longer distant, but holding back a laugh. Like a man about to tell the punch line of a really good joke. â€œBut I canâ€™t really help you with the techs.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShit, Miller, you pissed those people off, too?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller did laugh now, a free, soft sound that someone who wasnâ€™t piling on g could afford. If there was a punch line, Holden had missed it.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. â€œProbably. But thatâ€™s not why I canâ€™t get them for you. Iâ€™m not on the ship with them.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m still on Eros.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Fifty: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>What do you mean youâ€™re on Eros?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œPretty much that,â€� Miller said, covering his growing sense of shame with a casual tone of voice. â€œHanging upside down outside the tertiary docks, where we moored one of the ships. Feel like a freaking bat.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œButâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFunny thing, too. I didnâ€™t feel it when the thing moved. Youâ€™d think accelerating like that, it would have thrown me off or squashed me flat, one or the other. But there was nothing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, hold on. Weâ€™re coming to get you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHolden,â€� Miller said. â€œJust stop it, all right?â€�</p>
      <p>The silence didnâ€™t last more than a dozen seconds, but it carried a wealth of meaning. Itâ€™s not safe to bring the Rocinante to Eros, and I came here to die, and Donâ€™t make this harder than it is.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, I justâ€¦ â€� Holden said. And then: â€œOkay. Let meâ€¦ let me coordinate with the technicians. Iâ€™llâ€¦ Jesus. Iâ€™ll let you know what they say.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOne thing, though,â€� Miller said. â€œYouâ€™re talking about deflecting this sonofabitch? Just keep in mind itâ€™s not a rock anymore. Itâ€™s a ship.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRight,â€� Holden said. And a moment later: â€œOkay.â€�</p>
      <p>The connection dropped with a tick. Miller checked his oxygen supply. Three hours in-suit, but he could head back to his little ship and refill it well before that. So Eros was moving, was it? He still didnâ€™t feel it, but watching the curved surface of the asteroid, he could see micro-asteroids, all coming from the same direction, bouncing off. If the station kept accelerating, theyâ€™d start coming more often, more powerfully. Heâ€™d need to stay in the ship.</p>
      <p>He turned his hand terminal back to the Eros feed. The station beneath him was chirping and muttering, long slow vowel sounds radiating out from it like recorded whale song. After the angry words and static, the voice of Eros sounded peaceful. He wondered what kind of music Diogoâ€™s friends would be making out of this. Slow dancing didnâ€™t seem like their style. An annoying itch settled in the small of his back, and he shifted in his suit, trying to rub it away. Almost without his noticing it, he grinned. And then laughed. A wave of euphoria passed into him.</p>
      <p>There was alien life in the universe, and he was riding on it like a tick on a dog. Eros Station had moved of its own free will and by mechanisms he couldnâ€™t begin to imagine. He didnâ€™t know how many years it had been since heâ€™d yearsign… been overwhelmed by awe. Heâ€™d forgotten the feeling. He raised his arms to his sides, reaching out as if he could embrace the endless dark vacuum below him.</p>
      <p>Then, with a sigh, he turned back toward the ship.</p>
      <p>Back in the protective shell, he took off the vac suit and hooked the air supply to the recyclers to charge up. With only one person to care for, even low-level life support would have it ready to go within the hour. The ship batteries were still almost fully charged. His hand terminal chimed twice, reminding him that it was once again time for the anti-cancer meds. The ones heâ€™d earned the last time heâ€™d been on Eros. The ones heâ€™d be on for the rest of his life. Good joke.</p>
      <p>The fusion bombs were in the shipâ€™s cargo hold: gray square boxes about half again as long as they were tall, like bricks in a mortar of pink adhesive foam. It took Miller twenty minutes of searching through storage lockers to find a can of solvent that still had charge in it. The thin spray from it smelled like ozone and oil, and the stiff pink foam melted under it. Miller squatted beside the bombs and ate a ration bar that tasted convincingly like apples. Julie sat beside him, her head resting weightlessly on his shoulder.</p>
      <p>There had been a few times that Miller had flirted with faith. Most had been when he was young and trying out everything. Then when he was older, wiser, more worn, and in the crushing pain of the divorce. He understood the longing for a greater being, a huge and compassionate intelligence that could see everything from a perspective that dissolved the pettiness and evil and made everything all right. He still felt that longing. He just couldnâ€™t convince himself it was true.</p>
      <p>And still, maybe there was something like a plan. Maybe the universe had put him in the right place at the right time to do the thing that no one else would do. Maybe all the pain and suffering heâ€™d been through, all the disappointments and soul-crushing years wallowing through the worst that humanity had to offer up, had been meant to bring him here, to this moment, when he was ready to die if it bought humanity a little time.</p>
      <p>It would be pretty to think so, Julie said in his mind.</p>
      <p>â€œIt would,â€� he agreed with a sigh. At the sound of his voice, the vision of her vanished, just another daydream.</p>
      <p>The bombs were heavier than heâ€™d remembered. Under a full g, he wouldnâ€™t have been able to move them. At only one-third, it was a struggle, but possible. An agonizing centimeter at a time, he dragged one of them onto a handcart and hauled it to the airlock. Eros, above him, sang to itself.</p>
      <p>He had to rest before he tackled the hard work. The airlock was thin enough that only the bomb or he could fit through at a time. He climbed on top of it to get out the outer airlock door, then had to lift the bomb out with straps he rigged from cargo netting. And once out, it had to be tethered to the ship with magnetic clamps to keep Erosâ€™ spin from slinging it out into the void. After heâ€™d pulled it out and strapped it to the cart, he stopped to rest for half an hour.</p>
      <p>There were more impacts now, a rough sign that Eros was indeed accelerating. Each one a rifle shot, capable of bouncing clean through him or the ship behind him if bad luck sent it in the right direction. But the odds were low of one of the occasional rocks lining up a killing shot with his tiny antlike figure crawling across the surface. Once Eros cleared the Belt, theyâ€™d stop, anyway. Was Eros leaving the Belt? He realized he had no idea where Eros was going. Heâ€™d assumed it was Earth. Holden would know by now, pro. Holdnk w, pro.bably.</p>
      <p>His shoulders ached a little from his efforts, but not badly. He worried that heâ€™d overloaded the cart. Its wheels were stronger than his mag boots, but they could still be overcome. The asteroid above him lurched once, a new and unsettling motion that didnâ€™t repeat. His hand terminal cut off the Eros feed, alerting him that he had an incoming connection. He looked at it, shrugged, and let the call come through.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi,â€� he said before she could speak. â€œHowâ€™ve you been doing?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>The silence between them stretched.</p>
      <p>â€œYou talked to Holden, then?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI did,â€� she said. â€œHeâ€™s still talking about ways to get you off that thing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHeâ€™s a good guy,â€� Miller said. â€œTalk him out of it for me, okay?â€�</p>
      <p>The silence hung long enough that Miller started to get uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat are you doing there?â€� she asked. As if there were an answer for that. As if all his life could be summarized in answer to one simple question. He danced around what she meant and replied only to what sheâ€™d said.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, Iâ€™ve got a nuclear bomb strapped to a cargo wagon. Iâ€™m hauling it over to the access hatch and taking it into station.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMillerâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe thing is, we were treating this like a rock. Now everyone knows thatâ€™s a little simplistic, but itâ€™s going to take people time to adjust. Navies are still going to be thinking of this thing like a billiard ball when itâ€™s really a rat.â€�</p>
      <p>He was talking too fast. The words spilling out of him in a rush. If he didnâ€™t give her room, she wouldnâ€™t talk. He wouldnâ€™t have to hear what she had to say. He wouldnâ€™t have to keep her from talking him down.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s going to have structure. Engines or control centers. Something. If I truck this thing inside, get it close to whatever coordinates the thing, I can break it. Turn it back into a billiard ball. Even if itâ€™s just for a little while, that gives the rest of you a chance.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI figured,â€� she said. â€œIt makes sense. Itâ€™s the right thing to do.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller chuckled. A particularly solid impact tocked against the ship beneath him, the vibration of it jarring his bones. Gas started venting out of the new hole. The station was moving faster.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� he said. â€œWell.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI was talking to Amos,â€� she said. â€œYou need a dead manâ€™s switch. So that if something happens, the bomb still goes off. If you have the access codesâ€¦?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI do.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood. Iâ€™ve got a routine you can put on your hand terminal. Youâ€™ll need to keep your finger on the select button. If you go away for five seconds, it sends the go signal. If you want, I can upload it to you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo I have to wander around the station with my finger mashed on a button?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomiâ€™s tone made it an apology. â€œThey might take you out with a head shot. Or wrestle you down. The longer the gap, the more chance for the protomolecule to disable the bomb before it goes off. If you need more, I can reprogram it.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller looked at the bomb resting on  lookeateng on  its cart just outside the shipâ€™s airlock. Its readouts all glowed green and gold. His sigh briefly fogged the inside of his helmet.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, no. Five is good. Upload the routine. Am I going to need to tweak it, or is there a simple place I can put the arm-and-fire string?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s a setup section,â€� Naomi said. â€œIt prompts you.â€�</p>
      <p>The hand terminal chirped, announcing the new file. Miller accepted it, ran it. It was easy as keying in a door code. Somehow he felt that arming fusion bombs to detonate around him should have been more difficult.</p>
      <p>â€œGot it,â€� he said. â€œWeâ€™re good to go. I mean, I still have to move this bastard, but other than that. How fast am I accelerating on this thing, anyway?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEventually it will be faster than the Roci can go. Four g and ramping up with no sign of easing off the throttle.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCanâ€™t feel it at all,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m sorry about before,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œIt was a bad situation. We did what we had to do. Same as always.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSame as always,â€� she echoed.</p>
      <p>They didnâ€™t speak for a few seconds.</p>
      <p>â€œThanks for the trigger,â€� Miller said. â€œTell Amos I appreciate it.â€�</p>
      <p>He cut the connection before she could answer. Long goodbyes werenâ€™t anyoneâ€™s strong suit. The bomb rested in the handcart, magnetic clamps in place and a wide woven-steel belt around the whole mess. He moved slowly across the metallic surface of the port docks. If the cart lost its grip on Eros, he wouldnâ€™t be strong enough to hold it back. Of course, if one of the increasingly frequent strikes hit him, it would be a lot like getting shot, so waiting around wasnâ€™t a good solve either. He put both dangers out of his mind and did the work. For ten nervous minutes, his suit smelled of overheating plastic. All the diagnostics showed within the error bars, and by the time the recyclers cleared it, his air supply still looked good. Another little mystery he wasnâ€™t going to solve.</p>
      <p>The abyss above him shone with unflickering stars. One of the dots of light was Earth. He didnâ€™t know which one.</p>
