			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">The airplane climbed and Wil waited for the chopper to shoot at them, or crash into them, or explode for no reason, who knew. But minutes passed with nothing but the drone of the engines and the night spreading out ahead. “Are we clear?” he asked Tom, or T. S. Eliot, or whoever he was, and Eliot said nothing, but Wil thought they were. Exhaustion dumped into him all at once: One minute he was in fear for his life, the next he wanted to sleep. “I’m going to sit down, okay?” He made his way down the plane. He reached seats and collapsed into one. He should buckle up. But the buckles were so far away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He opened his eyes to daylight. The world bumped and shook. He clutched at the armrests, his head full of half-remembered dreams. A girl with bad words. A kangaroo. The engines were wailing. Beyond the round windows he saw snow and wooden fence posts and these seemed very close and moving too fast. The note of the engines changed and they began to shed speed. The world slowed and stopped. Eliot emerged from the cockpit, flipped open a panel on the fuselage, and began to crank the door.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where are we?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot kept cranking. The door became a series of steps and he trotted down them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil got to his feet. He was not thrilled about heading out into the snow again, but he did it. Eliot stood at the side of the road, urinating. Wil looked around. The blacktop stretched out as far as he could see. Power lines marched alongside. There was nothing else.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Nice landing,” Wil said. He got nothing from Eliot but a steady stream of urine. “Where are we?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot zipped and walked a short distance down the road. Wil went after him. The plane was very modern, he noticed, sleek and clean with upturned wings. It was surprisingly large, too, although maybe that was because it was on a road, where it did not belong.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stopped beside Eliot. He stuffed his hands into his pockets. His breath fogged. “What now?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Next car that comes along, I’m catching a ride. Then I’m going to get some breakfast. Bacon, ideally. Lots of bacon.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil shook snow from his boots. “Okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s me, though. You can do whatever you like.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil squinted. “Say what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re done. This is it. You go your way, I go mine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s over.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But the poets. Woolf . . . does she still want to kill me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So we have to hide. Go to more of your friends.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There are no more friends.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil stared. “No?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You mean your entire, what, resistance or whatever, got wiped out yesterday? <em class="calibre1">Everyone?</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You don’t have a cell in another city or—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jesus.” Wil exhaled. “Then we need to stick together.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hmm,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“She’s coming after you, too, right? Woolf wants you dead.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So from your point of view, I’m a guy who can keep you alive. But from my point of view, you’re a useless sack of shit. You don’t help me at all.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You said I was important! You have to find out why I’m immune! To the words!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That was before,” Eliot said. “Circumstances changed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m coming with you,” said Wil. “Wherever you’re going, I’m coming.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, you’re not.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can’t stop me. Your word voodoo, it doesn’t work on me. Right? So how do you think you’re going to—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot produced a pistol. He didn’t seem to pull it from anywhere. He just suddenly had it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil’s eyes stung.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“See?” Eliot put away the gun. “There are all kinds of persuasion.” He gazed at the horizon again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil’s breath steamed. “Okay. Okay.” Anger built inside him and he didn’t know what to do with it. “Fine. That’s how it is?” He walked back to the plane. He didn’t know what he was doing. But he could do it somewhere warm. He could do that. Halfway up the steps, he yelled, “What happened in Broken Hill? Woolf killed everyone, right?” Eliot didn’t move. “Yeah! So you go hide out while she does what she likes to the rest of us! You do that!” He shivered. He stomped up the steps.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Eliot stood on the road, scanning the horizon. His coat flapped around his legs. Wil would pop back out of that plane in about five minutes, by his estimation. That would be the point at which his fear of being abandoned surpassed his physiological desire for warmth. It would be useful if a car appeared before then. That way, Eliot could compromise the driver and be on his way without ever seeing Wil again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The wind stung his cheeks. He couldn’t resist the comparison any longer: the last time he’d stood like this, waiting and watching to see what came over the horizon, carrying a gun and hoping not to need it. A little over a year ago. He had been outside Broken Hill.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He put the air-conditioning on full, but it made no difference: The sun blasted through the windshield, broiling him inside his shirt. The kid he’d collected from the airport, Campbell, squirmed and twisted his tie and finally pulled off his linen jacket and hung it over the back of his seat. “The sun looks bigger,” he said. “Can it actually be bigger?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s the ozone,” said Eliot. “There’s a hole.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you get used to it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not yet.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When I left DC, it was twelve degrees,” said the kid, rolling up his sleeves. “Twelve.” He glanced at Eliot. “You miss DC?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I visit.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah, but . . .” The kid looked out the window at the blasted soil rolling by. “How long have you been out here, in total? Three months?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Seven.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah.” The kid nodded. “Of course. Well, after this, you can go home.” He smiled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot looked at him. “How old are you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Twenty-one. Why?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How much do you know about what you’re doing?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Everything.” The kid laughed. “Eliot, I’m fully briefed. I’ve spent six weeks in intensive prep. I was selected for my talents. I know what I’m doing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot said nothing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Four months ago, Virginia Woolf releases a bareword in Broken Hill, Australia, population three thousand. Now population zero. Official story, explosion in the ore refinery plant causing a catastrophic toxic leak. Town is fenced off at a radius of five miles. Scary signs promise death to all who enter. The funny part is the signs don’t lie. We send people in, they don’t come out. Hence the theory that the word is still in there.” He pulled his shirt out of his pants and flapped air. “Crazy idea, isn’t it? That a word can persist. Hang in the air, like an echo.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It can’t.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What, then? Because something bad is in there, and it ain’t a toxic leak.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He almost didn’t say it. “Maybe Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Mmm,” said the kid. “Yeah, nobody really thinks that’s plausible, Eliot. We’re all pretty sure Woolf’s dead.” He tapped idly on the window. “We have satellite on that town. We’ve imaged it a hundred different ways. Nothing moves.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot drove in silence.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m the best there is, defensively,” said the kid. “I mean, not to boast. But that’s why I’m here. I was selected because I can’t be compromised. There’s not going to be a problem.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You realize you’re betting your life on that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I realize it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot glanced at him. <em class="calibre1">Twenty-one</em>, he thought. “Who chose you? Yeats?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have had the honor of speaking with Yeats, yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You don’t have to do this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid looked at him. <em class="calibre1">Give me a sign</em>, Eliot thought, <em class="calibre1">and we’ll blow right by Broken Hill, Campbell, keep going until we reach an airport. By sundown we’ll be a country away. You ever think about quitting, Campbell? Just walking away? And let me ask you something else: Have you noticed there’s something wrong with Yeats? Like something dead? Notice that?</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid turned away. “You’ve been in the desert too long, Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He watched the endless road. “You’re right about that,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He drove up to the chain-link fence and killed the engine. They sat in silence, looking at the signs. <span class="SCAP1">CONTAMINATION. TOXIC. TRESPASS. DEATH.</span> Skulls and thick red lines. The heat pressed in like a hand. “They’re words, aren’t they?” said the kid. “Fear words.” He unbuckled. “I need to get out of this car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Outside was no cooler but at least the air was moving, stirring dust and sand. The road was blocked with a snarl of razor wire. To the left and right, the chain-link fence stretched away, signs flapping every few hundred feet. A few scrubby bushes protruded from the red soil. This continued as far as one could see.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He had wire cutters in the trunk, just in case, but nothing had changed since last time: The wire looped across the road but was not secured. It didn’t need to be. The kid was right: It was the words that kept people out. Eliot dragged the wire from the road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid was trying to wrap his linen jacket around his head. “I have a hat in the back,” said Eliot. “Take that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Take the hat.” He opened the back door and retrieved the cap and a bottle of water.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fine. Thanks.” The kid jammed the cap on his head. The peak said: <span class="SCAP1">THE THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER</span>. Eliot had picked it up from a street vendor in Adelaide. “How do I look?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have a satellite phone?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yep.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Call me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It works. I checked at the airport. I’ll call you when I get into town.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Call me now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid produced his phone and poked at it. Eliot’s phone trilled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay?” said the kid.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have a backup battery.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I do.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And your main is full?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s fine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is it full?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Look.” The kid showed him the screen. “See the little battery? I know how to use a phone.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Call me as soon as you can no longer see me clearly. Then keep the line open. If the call drops, keep trying me until you get through.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Will do.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s your segment?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">What?</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is it ninety-three?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid’s face blanked. It was how they trained them. The kid was thinking about something else: something happy, something sad, something traumatic; only he knew. It was supposed to make him unreadable, by adding noise to his facial expression.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re a ninety-three.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shit,” said the kid. “You’re not supposed to do that. Why’d you do that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“For your protection.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It doesn’t matter. I can’t be compromised. You want to try me? Go ahead.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot considered it. He didn’t doubt that the kid was good. But he’d probably done most of his work in a relatively controlled environment. If Eliot jumped him, put a gun in his mouth, screamed words, well, that was not the same.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t worry about me,” said the kid. “I’m good to go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t take any risks. Anything looks wrong, don’t investigate. Just walk away. We don’t have to do everything today.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid adjusted his <span class="SCAP1">DOWN UNDER</span> cap. He thought Eliot was crazy, of course. “Well, I’m going to do this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot nodded. “Good luck.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Heh,” said the kid. “Thanks.” He stepped around the razor wire and began to walk up the road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">With distance, the kid’s body shimmered in the heat haze rising out of the blacktop. Soon he was hard to make out at all, just another twisting current of air. Eliot stood with a hand shielding his face from the sun, watching.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His cell phone rang.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thanks for the cap,” said the kid. “Glad I’ve got it now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re welcome.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have seriously never been this hot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Can you see the town’s outskirts?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not yet.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Should be close.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah, I know. I have the maps by heart.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They fell silent. The sun beat down on Eliot’s head. He should retreat to the car. In a few minutes. He would wait until the kid reached the town.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You used to teach her at the Academy. Virginia Woolf. That’s what I heard. Is that true?” The kid was panting a little. “We have to spend an hour on the phone, Eliot; we may as well talk. Jesus.” He blew air. “This is so ridiculously hot.” Eliot heard him take a swig from the water bottle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes, I taught Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Did you see it coming? At all, I mean? Did you ever get the sense she might . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Might what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Go ballistic,” said the kid. “Kill a whole town. I don’t mean to insult your observation skills, which are, clearly, very good. I just wonder how you can miss something like that. You know? It wasn’t just you. It was everyone. We’re supposed to know people.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s a risk in training anyone. In Woolf’s case, her potential seemed to justify it.” He shrugged, although there was no one to see him. “We were wrong.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I never met her. She’d left by the time I started.” He coughed. “She’d been kicked out, I mean. Banished. Whatever. It’s really dusty. The wind . . . I think I can see the refinery.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Keep your eyes open.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid laughed, which turned into another cough. “Seriously, you’re making me nervous for no reason. There’s nobody in here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot said nothing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you know what I do? In the organization? I’m in Digital. Web services. You know?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not really.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You should. This is where everything is going. Let me tell you about it. Bring you up to speed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fine,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, don’t humor me. I don’t care. I’m just offering you an inside look at what Yeats himself has called, quote, the greatest attack vector since print, end quote.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The organization is changing, Eliot. It’s not newspapers and TV anymore. That stuff is old school. Obsolete. And you older guys, if you don’t watch out, you’ll be obsolete with it. You don’t want to be obsolete, do you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. So let me help you out.” The kid panted awhile. “The key to the Web is it’s interactive. That’s the difference. Online, someone visits your site, you can have a little poll there. It says, ‘Hey, what do you think about the tax cuts?’ And people click and segment themselves. First advantage right there. You’re not just proselytizing, speaking into the void. You’re getting data back. But here’s the really clever part. Your site isn’t static. It’s dynamically generated. Do you know what that means?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It means the site looks different to different people. Let’s say you chose the poll option that said you’re in favor of tax cuts. Well there’s a cookie on your machine now, and when you look at the site again, the articles are about how the government is wasting your money. The site is dynamically selecting content based on what you want. I mean, not what you <em class="calibre1">want</em>. What will piss you off. What will engage your attention and reinforce your beliefs, make you trust the site. And if you said you were <em class="calibre1">against</em> tax cuts, we’ll show you stories of Republicans blocking social programs or whatever. It works every which way. Your site is made of mirrors, reflecting everyone’s thoughts back at them. That’s pretty great, right?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s great.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And we haven’t even started talking about keywords. This is just the beginning. Third major advantage: People who use a site like this tend to ramp up their dependence on it. Suddenly all those other news sources, the ones that aren’t framing every story in terms of the user’s core beliefs, they start to seem confusing and strange. They start to seem biased, actually, which is kind of funny. So now you’ve got a user who not only trusts you, you’re his major source of information on what’s happening in the world. Boom, you own that guy. You can tell him whatever you like and no one’s contradicting you. He’s—” The kid sucked in breath. “Aw, shit.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think I see a body.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You didn’t know there would be bodies?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I knew. Of course I knew. But knowing and seeing are two . . . aw, geez. That’s disgusting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’ve been in the sun for four months.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah. Clearly.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is it just bone or . . . ?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s <em class="calibre1">mostly</em> bone,” said the kid. “That’s the disgusting part.” For a while Eliot heard nothing but his breathing. “Yecch. They’re all over.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You were telling me about Digital.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How do you think they died?” His voice sounded muffled, as if he was talking through his sleeve. “Did the bareword blow out their fucking brains? Like aneurysms? Because it doesn’t look like they died from aneurysms.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why not?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re in clumps. Like they dragged themselves into groups. Then died.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot was silent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So . . . yeah, Digital.” The kid’s voice wavered. “Fourth advantage. We can whisper. A problem with old media has always been that we can’t control who’s watching. There’s self-selection—people don’t tune in for shows that rub against their beliefs—but you still get people from the wrong segment watching. And they think you’re peddling bullshit, of course, because you are, and sometimes they make a big deal out of that, and it feeds back to the target segment. Then you have message bleeding. In Digital, that problem goes away. You can say things to a user and no one else can hear, because it’s dynamically generated for that user. The next user, the site looks different. End result, you get people from different segments and they agree on nothing, literally nothing, except the site is a great source of unbiased information.” He took a breath. “I’m passing houses. Flat, ugly houses.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you okay?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah. Fine. Just hot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Take a rest if you need it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why do you think they’re in groups?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You think they could be families? Like . . . they had time to find their loved ones?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Maybe.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t think that’s it. Something about the way . . . I don’t know. But I don’t think so.” Something scraped against the phone. “I need a drink.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Rest.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid gulped water. “No. I want to get this done.” Time passed. “So . . . that’s Digital. Pretty great, huh?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It makes me wonder why we’re bothering with anything else.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Heh. Yeah. Well, we have a problem with unidentified users. Someone visits our site for the first time, and we have no idea who they are. We don’t know what to show them. We can make guesses, based on where they are geographically, and the software they’re using. But that’s suboptimal. We’re getting better. You know about social networking?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You are . . . you need to get into this stuff, Eliot. It’s the future. Everyone’s making pages for themselves. Imagine a hundred million people clicking polls and typing in their favorite TV shows and products and political leanings, day after day. It’s the biggest data profile ever. And it’s voluntary. That’s the funny part. People resist a census, but give them a profile page and they’ll spend all day telling you who they are. Which is . . . good . . . for us . . . obviously . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s a . . . ah, it’s okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Gas station. Place is burned out. Cars all over. And one is . . . yeah, one is upside down. That’s . . . uh . . . not bad, huh, Eliot? A word that can flip cars?” He laughed, the pitch high. “That’s some pretty fucking impressive neurolinguistics, wouldn’t you say?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are there bodies?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Of course there are bodies! I’m fucking knee-deep in bodies! Just assume there are bodies unless I tell you otherwise!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Understood.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He panted. “I’m not knee-deep. I’m . . . sorry, I’m exaggerating. But there are a lot. A real lot.” He swallowed over and over. “How could there be so many? I mean, what did she do? How could she kill <em class="calibre1">everyone</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Take a break.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Campbell. You need to calm down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can see the hospital. It’s just up the road. The road that’s fucking full of bodies.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can come back. You don’t need to do this today.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid took a shaky breath. “Yeah, I do, Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s not that important. Forget about Yeats.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was a snuffling sound. Eventually Eliot identified it as laughter. “You have definitely been away too long, Eliot. No question. ‘Forget about Yeats.’ Jesus fucking Christ.” He sucked air. “There’s a lot of damage here. Cars on the sidewalk. I saw this on the satellite pictures, but up close it’s . . . more real, I guess. On the computer they just looked badly parked. Like everyone was in a real hurry. But . . . they hit things. They’re all . . . all somewhere for a reason.” He swallowed. “Almost at the hospital. Looks . . . smaller . . . than I expected, actually. Like a library. I can see the entrance to the ER. Ambulance out front. I mean a van. A paramedic van, up on the curb. Front of the ER’s all glass, but I can’t see inside.” He heard the kid stop. “It’s real dark in there. Or grimy or something.” He hesitated. “I’m going around to the main entrance, okay?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s just, I don’t think I need to mess with this black room if there’s another way in.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Agreed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay. I’m coming up on the main doors. Shit. I don’t even know if this is better.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tell me what you see.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Bodies. Desiccated bodies, piled against the glass. But I can see inside, at least. I’m at the doors. There’s . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?” He waited. “Campbell?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s a sound.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What kind of sound?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know. Shut up a second; let me listen.” Time passed. “Like a hum.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A person?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. Like a machine. Something electronic. But that can’t be right. There’s no power here. It’s not that loud. I’m going to open the doors.” There was a scraping. He heard the kid gagging. “<em class="calibre1">Fucking hell.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What is it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The <em class="calibre1">smell</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop where you are.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay. Okay. I’ve stopped.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Look around. Tell me everything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Seats. Reception desk. Shit on the walls.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shit?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I mean stuff. Ads. Get your vaccinations. Eight out of ten mothers experience postnatal depression. When was your last prostate exam.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What about the sound?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh. Yeah, that’s flies. Ten billion flies.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stand there a minute.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Time passed. “She’s not here, Eliot. I told you. If there was anything bigger than a squirrel moving around in here, we’d know it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Rabbit. There are no squirrels in Australia.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No . . .” The kid broke out in laughter. “No squirrels? Are you shitting me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well maybe I’ll fucking move here! It’s starting to seem like fucking paradise!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Keep it together.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid’s breathing came harsh and ragged. “You’re right. You’re right.” He steadied. “I’m going in.” There was a scrape. The ambient noise altered, thickening. “I’m inside.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tell me everything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There are lines on the floor. Colored lines. Man . . . well, I guess I’ll follow the red one. For Emergency. There are so many bodies . . . it’s hard to avoid them. Jesus fuck. I am never getting this smell off me.” Shuffling. “Doors are propped open with bodies. I’m in a corridor. It’s getting darker. The, ah . . . yeah, the lights don’t work. Just confirming that. There’s . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s a skull with an ax in it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“An ax?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah. A red ax. For fighting fires. I can see where someone pulled it out of the case. Someone broke the glass and took the ax out and buried it in this dude’s head. Hey? Eliot?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m taking the ax. Okay? I just . . . I’d feel better if I had it with me. So I’m going to put down the phone for a minute to pick up the ax.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The phone went <em class="calibre1">clunk</em>. He heard the kid grunting, then a brief squeal. “You there?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I got it.” The kid laughed. “I just pulled a fucking ax out of a skull.” He exhaled. “I feel better. I feel kind of badass. Hey. I just had an idea. I’m going to take a picture of this shit, send it to you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“On your phone?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Can you do that without ending the call?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t . . . uh . . . not sure.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then don’t do that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll send it and call you right back.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do not hang up the phone.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay. Jesus. Okay, okay. Just an idea. I can see the doors to Emergency up ahead. Double doors. Lots of . . . oh. I just figured out what this black stuff on the walls is.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Blood.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah. Lots and lots of blood.” A pause. “Is that . . . ? Yeah. That’s them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Who?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“An extraction team. I know these guys. I mean . . . I saw their video. You know these people in black suits Yeats uses sometimes? The soldiers with the goggles? They’re supposed to be screened against compromise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s them. Some of them, anyway. They’re not wearing their goggles. They . . . they’re pretty messed up.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re tangled. In each other. Their faces are black. Dried blood. They don’t have any eyes. I don’t know if . . . I don’t know if that’s decomposition or if . . . or what.” His voice shook. “They look like they went through a fucking shredder, Eliot.” He realized the kid was crying.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Campbell—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But they weren’t poets. That’s the difference. I’m the king of defense.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Come back. You can report in what you’ve learned. Try again tomorrow.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeats can wait another—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid’s voice rose. “Eliot, you have no fucking idea what’s required, okay? You’ve been in the fucking desert and you don’t know. I am not telling Yeats I got this far and left. That is not fucking happening, and if you had half a clue you wouldn’t suggest it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not all of us agree with Yeats.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid sucked air awhile. “I could have your head, Eliot. I could have your head on a plate for what you just said to me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah. Yeah.” Seconds passed. “Doors ahead. Closed double doors. Sign says Emergency.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Campbell, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I want to hold the ax in two hands. I’m going to wedge the phone under my ear.” There was a scraping. His breath came in gulps. “Hey, Eliot?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I appreciate it. Saying that about Yeats. That’s good of you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Campbell, please stop.” Command words rose in his mind. Weak, over the phone. Probably pointless.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If anything goes wrong, I want you to tell Yeats I was cool under pressure,” said the kid. “I’m opening the . . .” There was a squeal of hinges.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What do you see?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid’s breathing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Campbell? What do you see? Talk to me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The phone barked into his ear. He jerked it away. By the time he brought it back, there was nothing but dead air. It had hit the floor, he thought; that was the noise. The kid had dropped it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He thought he heard a faint squeak: the kid’s shoes? “Campbell?” He said the kid’s name again, and again, and again, and there was nothing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Eliot waited against the car as the sun settled behind him and heat bled from the air. He didn’t expect the kid to return. But he was giving him the chance.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Why are you here, Eliot? You see where the organization is going. You know what’s coming. Yet here you stand.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In an hour, it would be dark. Then he would climb into the car, drive four hours to his hotel, and phone Yeats. He would tell him Campbell had not come back, keeping his voice empty, and Yeats would express his sorrow, in the same tone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Emily, Emily</em>, he thought. <em class="calibre1">Where did you go</em>?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Something shimmered on the road. He squinted. The haze had lifted, but the wind blew dust into his eyes. Then he was sure: Someone was coming. Eliot straightened. He raised a hand. The figure didn’t respond. There was something odd about the way it was moving. Its gait was lopsided. Not Campbell? But it had to be. There was no one else out here.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A minute passed. The haze condensed into Campbell. The reason he was lopsided was that he was carrying an ax.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot returned to the car, opened the glove compartment, and retrieved his gun. By the time he returned to the fence line, Campbell was two hundred yards away. Eliot could see his expression, his focused emptiness.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stuck the pistol into his waistband and cupped his hands around his mouth. “<em class="calibre1">Campbell! Stop!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid kept coming. His shirt was soaked with sweat. Wet, matted hair poked from beneath the <span class="SCAP1">THUNDER FROM DOWN UNDER</span> cap. He had lost a shoe.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Campbell, drop the ax!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For a moment, he thought the kid was obeying. But no: He was hefting the ax over his shoulder. Fifty yards. Close enough to smell.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Vestid foresash raintrae valo! Stop!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid shambled through the words like they were water. Eliot drew the gun.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Stop! Campbell, stop! Valo! Stop! Valo!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The kid’s lips stretched back. The tendons along his forearms tightened. The ax rose. Eliot squeezed the trigger. The kid grunted. His expression didn’t change. Eliot pulled the trigger twice more. The ax clanged to the blacktop. The kid fell to his knees. He tried to rise, grunted again, and fell face forward onto the road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot sank to his haunches. The sun had almost set. The world was awash in orange. He rose and began to load the kid’s body into the car.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He buried the kid in the desert and drove through the night. When the city lights rose, he couldn’t stand it anymore, and pulled over onto the shoulder and climbed out. He leaned on the car and dialed, inhaling night air. Cars whizzed by. “Yes?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ah.” He heard a tinkling: ice in glass. “How are things proceeding?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Campbell’s dead.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He heard Yeats sip at his drink. “Do you mean he failed to return?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I mean I shot him in the chest.” He closed his eyes, but that was no better, so he opened them again. “I mean he came out of there carrying an ax and I shot him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You sound unsettled.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He dropped the phone from his ear. When he could, he raised it. “I’m fine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re saying Campbell came back insane. Is that correct?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. Insane. Compromised. Something.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you know how it happened?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He made it to the Emergency Room. We were talking. Then he just stopped.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How did he sound up to that point?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He was cool under pressure.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was silence. “It’s so intriguing,” Yeats said. “What I would give to know what she did in there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He waited.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Come home, Eliot. It’s been long enough.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I haven’t found Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Woolf is dead.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t believe that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop believing what you want to believe. It’s unbecoming. You’ve found no trace. Your assignment is terminated. Come home.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He laid his head against the cold metal of the car and closed his eyes. “Yes, sir.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">A dot appeared in the snowscape. A car? Yes. Eliot checked his coat, made sure the gun was out of sight.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Behind him, Wil’s footsteps clattered down the airplane steps. <em class="calibre1">That was quick</em>, Eliot thought. <em class="calibre1">He must have thought of something.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What happened to being <em class="calibre1">worth it</em>?” Wil shouted. “Isn’t that what you said to me? Those people who died back there, I had to make myself worth it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot didn’t answer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is that a car?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil’s shoes crunched toward him. He stopped beside Eliot, hugging himself. Eliot glanced at him. “Don’t leave me, you motherfucker,” Wil said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What? So . . . we’re good? We’re staying together?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then what the hell was that before? Was that a joke?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The car slowed. Eliot saw glassed-in faces gaping at the plane. “This will be easier if you’re calm.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you <em class="calibre1">fucking</em> with me now? I’m trying to deal with . . . magical, killer poets and you’re <em class="calibre1">fucking</em> with me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I reconsidered,” Eliot said. “You made a good point.” He walked toward the car.</p>
