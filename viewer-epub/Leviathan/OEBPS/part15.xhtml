      <h2>â€œFast contacts with no transponder signal,â€� Alex...</h2>
      <p>Holden pulled up the display. Six small signatures, yellow-orange shifting toward red. Heavy burn.</p>
      <p>â€œWell,â€� Holden said to the screen. â€œAnd who the hell are you?â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Eight: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Aggression against the Belt is what Earth and Mars survive on. Our weakness is their strength,â€� the masked woman said from Millerâ€™s terminal screen. The split circle of the OPA draped behind her, like something painted on a sheet. â€œDonâ€™t be afraid of them. Their only power is your fear.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWell, that and a hundred or so gunships,â€� Havelock said.</p>
      <p>â€œFrom what I hear,â€� Miller said, â€œif you clap your hands and say you believe, they canâ€™t shoot you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHave to try that sometime.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe must rise up!â€� the woman said, her voice growing shrill. â€œWe have to take our destiny before it is taken from us! Remember the Canterbury!â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shut the viewer down and leaned back in his chair. The station was at its change-of-shift surge, voices raised one over the other as the previous round of cops brought the incoming ones up to speed. The smell of fresh coffee competed with cigarette smoke.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s maybe a dozen like her,â€� Havelock said, nodding toward the dead terminal screen. â€œSheâ€™s my favorite, though. Thereâ€™re times I swear sheâ€™s actually foaming at the mouth.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow many more files?â€� Miller asked, and his partner shrugged.</p>
      <p>â€œTwo, three hundred,â€� Haveloch=“1em” ak said, and took a drag on his cigarette. Heâ€™d started smoking again. â€œEvery few hours, thereâ€™s a new one. They arenâ€™t coming from one place. Sometimes theyâ€™re broadcast on the radio. Sometimes the files show up on public partitions. Orlan found some guys at a portside bar passing out those little VR squids like they were pamphlets.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe bust them?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Havelock said as if it was no big deal.</p>
      <p>A week had passed since James Holden, self-appointed martyr, had proudly announced that he and his crew were going to go talk to someone from the Martian navy instead of just slinging shit and implications. The footage of the Canterburyâ€™s death was everywhere, debates raging over every frame. The log files that documented the incident were perfectly legitimate, or they were obviously doctored. The torpedoes that had slaughtered the hauler were nukes or standard pirate fare that breached the drive by mistake, or it was all artifice lifted from old stock footage to cover up what had really killed the Cant.</p>
      <p>The riots had lasted for three days on and off, like a fire hot enough to reignite every time the air pumped back in. The administrative offices reopened under heavy security, but they reopened. The ports fell behind, but they were catching up. The shirtless bastard who Miller had ordered shot was in the Star Helix detainment infirmary, getting new knees, filling out protests against Miller, and preparing for his murder trial.</p>
      <p>Six hundred cubic meters of nitrogen had gone missing from a warehouse in sector fifteen. An unlicensed whore had been beaten up and locked in a storage unit; as soon as she was done giving evidence about her attackers, sheâ€™d be arrested. Theyâ€™d caught the kids whoâ€™d been breaking the surveillance cameras on level sixteen. Superficially, everything was business as usual.</p>
      <p>Only superficially.</p>
      <p>When Miller had started working homicide, one of the things that had struck him was the surreal calm of the victimsâ€™ families. People who had just lost wives, husbands, children, and lovers. People whose lives had just been branded by violence. More often than not, they were calmly offering drinks and answering questions, making the detectives feel welcome. A civilian coming in unaware might have mistaken them for whole. It was only in the careful way they held themselves and the extra quarter second it took their eyes to focus that Miller could see how deep the damage was.</p>
      <p>Ceres Station was holding itself carefully. Its eyes were taking a quarter second longer to focus. Middle-class peopleâ€”storekeepers, maintenance workers, computer techsâ€”were avoiding him on the tube the way petty criminals did. Conversations died when Miller came near. In the station, the sense of being under siege was growing. A month earlier, Miller and Havelock, Cobb and Richter, and the rest had been the steadying hand of the law. Now they were employees of an Earth-based security contractor.</p>
      <p>The difference was subtle, but it was deep. It made him want to stand taller, to show with his body that he was a Belter. That he belonged there. It made him want to win peopleâ€™s good opinion back. Let by a bunch of guys passing out virtual reality propaganda with a warning, maybe.</p>
      <p>It wasnâ€™t a smart impulse.</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™ve we got on the board?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œTwo burglaries that look like that same ring,â€� Havelock said. â€œThat domestic dispute from last week still needs the report closed up. There was a pretty good assault over by Nakanesh Import Conhere wmposortium, but Shaddid was talking to Dyson and Patel about that, so itâ€™s probably spoken for already.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo you wantâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>Havelock looked up and out to cover the fact that he was looking away. It was something heâ€™d been doing more often since things had gone to shit.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™ve really got to get the reports done,â€� Havelock said. â€œNot just the domestic. Thereâ€™re four or five folders that are only still open because they need to be crossed and dotted.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Since the riots, heâ€™d watched everyone in a bar get served before Havelock. Heâ€™d seen how the other cops from Shaddid down went out of their way to reassure Miller that he was one of the good guys, a tacit apology for saddling him with an Earther. And heâ€™d seen Havelock see it too.</p>
      <p>It made Miller want to protect the man, to let Havelock spend his days in the safety of paperwork and station house coffee. Help the man pretend that he wasnâ€™t hated for the gravity heâ€™d grown up in.</p>
      <p>That wasnâ€™t a smart impulse either.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat about your bullshit case?â€� Havelock asked.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>Havelock held up a folder. The Julie Mao case. The kidnap job. The sideshow. Miller nodded and rubbed his eyes. Someone at the front of the station house yelped. Someone else laughed.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, no,â€� Miller said. â€œHavenâ€™t touched it.â€�</p>
      <p>Havelock grinned and held it out to him. Miller accepted the file, flipped it open. The eighteen-year-old grinned out at him with perfect teeth.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t want to saddle you with all the desk driving,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, youâ€™re not the one that kept me off that one. That was Shaddidâ€™s call. And anywayâ€¦ itâ€™s just paperwork. Never killed anyone. You feel guilty about it, you can buy me a beer after work.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller tapped the case against the corner of his desk, the small impacts settling the contents against the folderâ€™s spine.</p>
      <p>â€œRight,â€� he said. â€œIâ€™ll go do some follow-up on the bullshit. Iâ€™ll be back by lunch, write something up to keep the boss happy.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll be here,â€� Havelock said. Then, as Miller rose: â€œHey. Look. I didnâ€™t want to say anything until I was sure, but I also donâ€™t want you to hear it someplace elseâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPut in for a transfer?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah. Talked to some of those Protogen contractors that passed through. They say their Ganymede office is looking for a new lead investigator. And I thoughtâ€¦ â€� Havelock shrugged.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s a good move,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œJust want to go someplace with a sky, even if you look at it through domes,â€� Havelock said, and all the bluff masculinity of police work couldnâ€™t keep the wistfulness out of his voice.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s a good move,â€� Miller said again.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Juliette Andromeda Maoâ€™s hole was in the ninth level of a fourteen-tiered tunnel near the port. The great inverted V was almost red tus ahalf a kilometer wide at the top, and no more than a standard tube width at the bottom, the retrofit of one of a dozen reaction mass chambers from the years before the asteroid had been given its false gravity. Now thousands of cheap holes burrowed into the walls, hundreds on each level, heading straight back like shotgun shacks. Kids played on the terraced streets, shrieking and laughing at nothing. Someone at the bottom was flying a kite in the constant gentle spin breeze, the bright Mylar diamond swerving and bucking in the microturbulence. Miller checked his terminal against the numbers painted on the wall. 5151-I. Home sweet home to the poor little rich girl.</p>
      <p>He keyed his override, and the dirty green door popped its seals and let him pass.</p>
      <p>The hole canted up into the body of the station. Three small rooms: general living space at the front, then a bedroom hardly larger than the cot it contained, then a stall with shower, toilet, and half sink all within elbow distance. It was a standard design. Heâ€™d seen it a thousand times.</p>
      <p>Miller stood for a minute, not looking at anything in particular, listening to the reassuring hiss of air cycling through ductwork. He reserved judgment, waiting as the back of his head built an impression of the place and, through it, of the girl whoâ€™d lived there.</p>
      <p>Spartan was the wrong word. The place was simple, yes. The only decorations were a small framed watercolor of a slightly abstracted womanâ€™s face over the table in the front room and a cluster of playing-card-sized plaques over the cot in the bedroom. He leaned close to read the small script. A formal award granting Julie Maoâ€”not Julietteâ€”purple belt status by the Ceres Center for Jiu Jitsu. Another stepping her up to brown belt. They were two years apart. Tough school, then. He put his fingers on the empty space on the wall where one for black could go. There was none of the affectationâ€”no stylized throwing stars or imitation swords. Just a small acknowledgment that Julie Mao had done what she had done. He gave her points for that.</p>
      <p>The drawers had two changes of clothes, one of heavy canvas and denim and one of blue linen with a silk scarf. One for work, one for play. It was less than Miller owned, and he was hardly a clotheshorse.</p>
      <p>With her socks and underwear was a wide armband with the split circle of the OPA. Not a surprise, for a girl whoâ€™d turned her back on wealth and privilege to live in a dump like this. The refrigerator had two takeaway boxes filled with spoiled food and a bottle of local beer.</p>
      <p>Miller hesitated, then took the beer. He sat at the table and pulled up the holeâ€™s built-in terminal. True to Shaddidâ€™s word, Julieâ€™s partition opened to Millerâ€™s password.</p>
      <p>The custom background was a racing pinnace. The interface was customized in small, legible iconography. Communication, entertainment, work, personal. Elegant. That was the word. Not Spartan, but elegant.</p>
      <p>He paged quickly through her professional files, letting his mind take in an overview, just as he had with the whole living space. There would be time for rigor, and a first impression was usually more useful than an encyclopedia. She had training videos on several different light transport craft. Some political archives, but nothing that raised a flag. A scanned volume of poetry by some of the first settlers in the Belt.</p>
      <p>He shifted to her personal correspondence. It was all kept as neat and controlled as a Belterâ€™s. All incoming messages were filtered to subfolders. Work, Personal, Broadcast, Shopping. He popped open Broadcast. Two or three hundred political. He ppol newsfeeds, discussion group digests, bulletins and announcements. A few had been viewed here and there, but nothing with any sort of religious observation. Julie was the kind of woman who would sacrifice for a cause, but not the kind whoâ€™d take joy in reading the propaganda. Miller filed that away.</p>
      <p>Shopping was a long tracking of simple merchant messages. Some receipts, some announcements, some requests for goods and services. A cancellation for a Belt-based singles circle caught his eye. Miller re-sorted for related correspondence. Julie had signed up for the â€œlow g, low pressureâ€� dating service in February of the previous year and canceled in June without having used it.</p>
      <p>The Personal folder was more diverse. At a rough guess there were sixty or seventy subfolders broken down by name. Some were peopleâ€”Sascha Lloyd-Navarro, Ehren Michaels. Others were private notationsâ€”Sparring Circle, OPA.</p>
      <p>Bullshit Guilt Trips.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, this could be interesting,â€� he said to the empty hole.</p>
      <p>Fifty messages dating back five years, all marked as originating at the Mao-Kwikowski Mercantile stations in the Belt and on Luna. Unlike the political tracts, all but one had been opened.</p>
      <p>Miller took a pull from the beer and considered the most recent two messages. The most recent, still unread, was from JPM. Jules-Pierre Mao, at a guess. The one immediately before it showed three drafted replies, none of them sent. It was from Ariadne. The mother.</p>
      <p>There was always an element of voyeurism in being a detective. It was legal for him to be here, poking through the private life of a woman heâ€™d never met. It was part of his legitimate investigation to know that she was lonely, that the only toiletries in her bathroom were her own. That she was proud. No one would have any complaints to make, or at least any that carried repercussions for his job, if he read every private message on her partition. Drinking her beer was the most ethically suspect thing heâ€™d done since heâ€™d come in.</p>
      <p>And still he hesitated for a few seconds before opening the second-to-last message.</p>
      <p>The screen shifted. On better equipment, it would have been indistinguishable from ink on paper, but Julieâ€™s cheap system shuddered at the thinnest lines and leaked a soft glow at the left edge. The handwriting was delicate and legible, either done with a calligraphic software good enough to vary letter shape and line width, or else handwritten.</p>
      <p>Sweetheart: Â  I hope everythingâ€™s going well for you. I wish you would write to me on your own sometimes. I feel like I have to put in a request in triplicate just to hear how my own daughter is doing. I know this adventure of yours is all about freedom and self-reliance, but surely thereâ€™s still room in there to be considerate.I wanted to get in touch with you especially because your father is going through one of his consolidation phases again, and weâ€™re thinking of selling the Razorback. I know it was important to you once, but I suppose weâ€™ve all given up on your racing again. Itâ€™s just racking up storage fees now, and thereâ€™s no call to be sentimental.</p>
      <p>It was signed with the flowing initials AM.</p>
      <p>Miller considered the words. Somehow heâ€™d expected the parental extortions of the very rich to be more scted tbe ubtle. If you donâ€™t do as we say, weâ€™ll get rid of your toys. If you donâ€™t write. If you donâ€™t come home. If you donâ€™t love us.</p>
      <p>Miller opened the first incomplete draft.</p>
      <p>Mother, if thatâ€™s what you call yourself:Thank you so much for dropping yet another turd onto my day. I canâ€™t believe how selfish and petty and crude you are. I canâ€™t believe you sleep at night or that you ever thought I could</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Miller skimmed the rest. The tone seemed consistent. The second draft reply was dated two days later. He skipped to it.</p>
      <p>Mom: Â  Iâ€™m sorry weâ€™ve been so estranged these last few years. I know itâ€™s been hard for you and for Daddy. I hope you can see that the decisions Iâ€™ve made were never meant to hurt either of you.About the Razorback, I wish youâ€™d reconsider. Sheâ€™s my first boat, and I</p>
      <p>It stopped there. Miller leaned back.</p>
      <p>â€œSteady on, kid,â€� he said to the imaginary Julie, then opened the last draft.</p>
      <p>Ariadne: Â  Do what you have to.Julie</p>
      <p>Miller laughed and raised his bottle to the screen in toast. Theyâ€™d known how to hit her where it hurt, and Julie had taken the blow. If he ever caught her and shipped her back, it was going to be a bad day for both of them. All of them.</p>
      <p>He finished the beer, dropped the bottle into the recycling chute, and opened the last message. He more than half dreaded learning the final fate of the Razorback, but it was his job to know as much as he could.</p>
