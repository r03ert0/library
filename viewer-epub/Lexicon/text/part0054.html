			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">“So you left her,” Harry said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot rubbed his forehead. His throat was sore; he had been talking for some time. It was taxing, because he was recovering from a near-death experience and outside the window forces were gathering to kill him. “That’s what you get from that story? That I left?” Harry didn’t respond. “Yes. I left. There was no alternative.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s always an alternative.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” he said. He felt tired. “It didn’t feel like it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What then?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeats sent her after me. I had this crazy idea that I’d be left alone if I went far enough away. That I could start a new life. But she came after me and systematically murdered everyone who was in the way.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“She’s probably compromised.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You think that makes a difference?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” said Harry, “because I can <em class="calibre1">un-</em>compromise her, with the bareword.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Can’t be done.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why not?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can’t erase an instruction. Not even with that. You would only create conflicting instructions.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Which means what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s unpredictable.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, that’s fucking something.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The original instruction won’t go anywhere. It could reassert itself at any moment, based on situational factors, such as where she is, how she’s feeling. Do you want to take that chance when one of the instructions is <em class="calibre1">kill everyone</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, you fucking can’t.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A low thrumming began outside. Harry peered out the window at the sky. “I love her.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He shook his head. “You’re misremembering.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I remember that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Listen to me carefully,” Eliot said, “because over the last twelve months, I have been highly motivated to figure out exactly what happened in Broken Hill, and as a result I know for a fact that your movements diverged from hers shortly after she left me facedown in a ditch. What I pieced together from this was that when she went to you and asked you to leave with her, you said no. This is how I first began to suspect your existence as an outlier. And it’s how I know you didn’t love her.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You said people are defined by what they want. That it’s the most important thing about them. Yes?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then I know who I am.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked out the window. “Well, terrific. That’s terrific, Wil. I’m so glad you could find your emotional core, before your ex-girlfriend murders us. Imagine what would happen if she got her hands on a bareword again. Imagine that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll keep it from her.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” said Eliot, “well, now we’re entering a magical fantasy land, because with all due respect to your newly regained assertiveness, you don’t have a hope in hell of keeping her from anything she wants. What’s that noise?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Choppers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“More than one? What do they look like?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why would she do anything to help this guy Yeats? She <em class="calibre1">must</em> be compromised. He’s <em class="calibre1">making</em> her chase us and you say she has to die for it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You think I like it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. I do. Because of Charlotte.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked at the ceiling. “Well,” he said. “Maybe you’re right.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So it doesn’t matter. Is it Woolf’s choice? Maybe not, but she is what she is. You, right now, are shooting at people for the crime of being compromised. Why is Woolf different? Also, may I add, she wasn’t made this way out of nowhere. Yeats sowed that seed in fertile ground.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry raised his voice over the din of the choppers. “Meaning what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Meaning she wiped out Broken Hill!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Maybe she was compromised <em class="calibre1">then</em>!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re choosing what you want to believe! Christ! I would love to believe that I didn’t let three thousand people die because I couldn’t see her for what she was. But I can’t. The truth is she was always like this and I refused to see it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I tell you what, how about we kill <em class="calibre1">Yeats</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure, we’ll ask Woolf to stand aside for a minute. Don’t look at me like that’s a realistic possibility. She’ll defend him to the death. And even if she could be circumvented somehow, Yeats being alive is what keeps Woolf in check. Remove him and she’s left with an instruction to <em class="calibre1">kill everyone</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry was watching out the window. The loudness of the choppers seemed to have leveled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You want a nightmare scenario? Yeats goes down, Woolf takes the bareword. Yeats cannot die. Not before Woolf.” Harry didn’t react. “What’s happening out there?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Guys coming out of choppers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What kind of guys?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Military. Big black helmets with goggles. Can’t see their faces.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ah,” said Eliot. “So we are completely fucked, then.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry looked at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Environmentally Isolated Personnel. They see the world through filters, to protect them against compromise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Should I shoot them?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure,” he said. “Why not?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry raised the rifle. A part of the window frame near his head exploded. He ducked against the wall. “Shit.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry moved to the other window, checked outside. “They’re encircling us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I would imagine they’re landing on the roof, too,” Eliot said. “Rappelling down from the choppers, perhaps.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What happened to Charlotte?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When I met you, you had a buddy. A whole bunch of guys, on that ranch. Including Charlotte. How did they get there?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Who gives a shit?” Eliot said. “Honestly, Harry. At this point, who cares? You think they’re going to take us alive?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry rubbed his chin, a gesture Eliot hadn’t seen before. “Under the mattress.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I got you a pistol from the armory. It’s under the mattress.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot stared at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You want to maybe get it out?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I maybe want to shoot you with it, if it would make any difference.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s going to be all right, Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No,” said Eliot, “these guys are going to kill us while Woolf watches from a distance. Sometime later, an unimaginable number of people are going to devote their lives to shifting dirt, because Yeats has developed a hankering to dig a very deep hole in one place and pile it up in another. That’s how it’s going to be, you stupid asshole. Those guys on the ranch? They were the ones I could persuade to leave the organization. I thought Charlotte was one of them, but it has since become abundantly clear that she was compromised by Woolf, and feeding back information, such as your existence, what we were planning, and so on, the entire time, and then she turned Charlotte against me and I had to shoot her! I had to fucking shoot her, Wil!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just get out the gun.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why bother?” he shouted. “Since Woolf is coming only to shower us with chocolates and kisses?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry paced.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” Eliot said. “Oh, oh, are we having regrets?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shut up.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Twenty years,” Eliot said. “My entire adult life, I’ve guarded every word that’s come out of my mouth. And you know what? I’m done. I am finally, completely fucking done. So hey-o! Fuck you, Wil Parke! Harry Wilson! Whoever you are! Fuck you very much! And fuck you, Yeats! And you, Emily Woolf! Fuck you the most of all!” He threw back the blanket. He slid a hand beneath the mattress and found metal. “Let’s go!” His body hurt everywhere but his mind was soaring. “Here we go, hey-o, diddle diddle!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Emily came out of the chopper and jogged to the shelter of a falling-down building that had once sold wire, apparently. She had forgotten about stores like this. Shops, she meant. Shops that only sold one thing, which you could not conceive of wanting. You could live a lifetime in DC and never see a wire store. If you wanted wire, you would go to a warehouse-style hypermarket and it would be one shelf in aisle twelve. But here it was a whole shop. You went in and asked for some wire, because the roos had knocked down a section of your side paddock fence again, and you would have a conversation about it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She hadn’t wanted to come back to Broken Hill. She had been operating for a while now as a compartmentalized person, putting different pieces of herself in different places, and she didn’t know what Broken Hill would do to that. But she was here, because she didn’t get to make choices about that kind of thing anymore, and had to do the best she could. One part of her, one of the compartments, was glad. It thought she was coming home. The rest was pretty freaked out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re deploying,” said Plath. Plath was running around with a headset that wouldn’t stay put, talking to security guys. Emily was not very happy with Plath. She had crossed paths with Plath a few times and each time Plath was more neurotic. There was something wild and jumpy in her eyes that Emily did not trust. Also, Plath had come on board shortly after the terrible failed attempt to corner Eliot and his outlier at the Portland airport, during which the poet Raine had died, and although Plath hadn’t said anything, Emily knew she viewed that incident as a shameful fuckup on Emily’s part. “It’s so hot.” Plath began to extract herself from her jacket. Emily was not wearing a jacket, because it had been obvious in advance that the desert would be hot. “Like an <em class="calibre1">oven</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” She watched Plath get her jacket tangled up in her headset.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll call Yeats, tell him we landed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He asked to be kept up to—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t call Yeats,” Emily said. She was still in charge. She was still the best in the organization at hunt-and-kill.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We need a command center,” said a man. His voice was machine modulated, coming out of a helmet. His name was Masters. He was in control of the soldiers. Currently, Masters had EIPs spreading through Broken Hill like a toxic spill, establishing perimeters, getting fixes, whatever else it was they did. It was to help her neutralize Eliot, but she didn’t like it, being around people she couldn’t compromise.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She remembered a burger place. It was a good distance from the hospital, close enough to coordinate the action but not so close that Eliot was likely to be able to sneak up and shoot her. She had eaten there, alone, sometimes, other times not. But she wasn’t thinking about that. Harry was trying to surface in her brain but she was not going to let him. The point was, it was a good location. “I know somewhere.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A small squad swept the burger place while she and Plath stood outside, shielding their faces from the sun. A chopper passed overhead, whipping up hot, stinging sand. “Ugh,” said Plath. “This place.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A soldier opened the rear door and gestured. She passed through a small kitchen, where a dark skillet lay under a layer of dust. Utensils dangled from overhead racks, surprisingly bright. Then she was in the serving area, passing familiar tables. There were no bodies. Maybe the soldiers had removed them. Plath hung back for some reason but Emily moved to the front of the store. There were dark shapes outside, hard to see through the dirty plate glass, and she approached with some trepidation. Outdoor tables. A ragged umbrella still over one of them. A few cars. If she put her face to the glass, she could see farther down the street. She didn’t look for detail but could see the shape of the hospital. Somewhere inside were Eliot and his outlier.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Her phone rang. She pulled it out. “I hear you’re in Broken Hill,” said Yeats.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” She looked at Plath, the snitch.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I find myself wondering why Eliot would go there, of all places.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, my guess is to get the word,” she said. “The outlier can just pick it up.” There was silence. “Hello?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry. I was rendered speechless a moment, just then.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The bareword,” she said. “It’s in the emergency room.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I <em class="calibre1">have</em> the bareword.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have the copy I made. The original is still there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How useful it would have been to have this information before this moment.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” she said. “I’m sorry.” She had known that, in one of her compartments.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You will kill Eliot,” Yeats said, “and the outlier, and, for that matter, anyone else Eliot has managed to conjure up who doesn’t work directly for me. You will then cordon off the hospital until I arrive. Is this clear?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” In her head, she added: <em class="calibre1">you jerk</em>. She did this sometimes. It was a kind of game.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I really am vexed by this outlier business. I have felt decidedly uncomfortable, knowing that one exists. It is a most unwelcome distraction to my work.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can imagine.” <em class="calibre1">You jerk.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Call me when Eliot’s dead,” he said. “I won’t set foot in Broken Hill until then. Oh, and Emily? At some point, you will fill me in on exactly how you managed to copy an object you can’t look at.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I will do that,” she said. The phone clicked. Her jaw worked and for a moment she thought she was actually going to say it. But she only made a little grunt, <em class="calibre1">yuh</em>. She glanced at Plath. But no one seemed to have noticed. So that was okay.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the beginning, she hadn’t even been able to think it. Perhaps eventually she would be able to say the words to his face. <em class="calibre1">Hey, Yeats! You’re a jerk!</em> It was a fun idea. Implausible; most likely, this was as far as it could go, a mental game. She would see. For now, the important thing was that a part of her was still her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Eliot strode to the door, pulled it open, and disappeared. This happened much more quickly than Harry expected, because until a few moments ago, Eliot had looked very much like a guy recovering from a near-fatal gunshot wound. What had suddenly revived him, Harry did not know. “Wait,” he said. But Eliot was running down the corridor; Harry could hear his footsteps.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He hefted the rifle. This was going to be especially useless for close-quarters combat. He hadn’t intended to leave the room. He’d intended to stay and pick off guys until Emily got the message and came to see him. He blew air through his teeth. “Fuck,” he said, and went after Eliot. He jogged down the corridor, passing two neonatal rooms that were once staffed by a woman named Helen who’d always had pink iced doughnuts, any time of day or night. Harry had never seen her eat one. She just had them. He’d visited this place often, for those doughnuts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He reached the corner and poked his head around. Eliot was nowhere to be seen. He had just fucking disappeared. Harry debated the merits of opening his mouth to make the kind of noise that might attract armed men, then there was a quick one-two of flat gunshots in the near distance, which decided him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He reached the stairwell and peered over the railing to see Eliot standing below him. At Eliot’s feet was a man in a black suit with no helmet. The man looked dazed. His gun, a semiautomatic, lay a few feet away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shoot them in the face,” Eliot said. “They’re armored, but it’s distracting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What did you do?” The man in the black suit began to grope for his gun. “He’s moving!” He raised the rifle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t!” said Eliot. “He’s on the side of the angels now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The man retrieved his gun and got to this feet. He looked up at Harry questioningly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He’s cool,” Eliot told the man. “Neither of you shoot the other.” He began to descend the steps.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How did you . . . ?” But Eliot had disappeared. Harry ran after him, jumping the steps three or four at a time. He caught Eliot at the top of the second floor, which was the surgical wing. “Will you fucking wait?” He went to seize Eliot by the shoulder but the black-suited man slapped his gun into his shoulder and looked down the barrel at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t alarm my prole,” Eliot said. “He wants to protect me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What do you think you’re doing?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Looking for Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“She could be anywhere.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. But it’s a better option than sitting in that room.” Eliot looked around. His pupils were dilated. “You used to work here. What’s a clever way out?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know. Can you tell this guy to stop pointing his fucking gun at me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He’s finding you threatening. So am I, actually.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You look like you’re on drugs.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m releasing a lot of dopamine,” Eliot said. “It’s a natural high. Joel! Gun down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The soldier lowered his gun. He stared at Harry with baleful eyes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How about a laundry chute?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A chute,” Eliot said, “that we slide down to a basement or some-such.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. They don’t work like that. This is a hospital—we’d lose children down them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What, then?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Think,” Eliot said. “You must have lost a few patients. People who snuck out somehow. It’s not Fort Knox.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No one . . . okay, one time a guy broke into a storage room by climbing onto the roof of the building next door. We might be able to—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. That.” Eliot looked at the soldier. “Go cause a distraction. Shoot at nothing. Report false information. Things like that.” The man nodded and began to jog down the stairs. “This storage room, then.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How did you compromise that guy?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know him. I used to work for the organization, you know. Storage room.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He led Eliot through double doors. He had never liked coming here. It was the surgeons. He’d never been completely sure they really gave a shit. They seemed to enjoy challenges more than people. “So you, what, shot him in the face, pulled off his helmet, and used words?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Correct,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He reached the storage room and tried the handle. No one had been by in the past year or so to unlock it, apparently. But he knew where the key was kept. He jogged down the corridor, pulled open the second drawer in the nurse’s station, and found it among paper clips and rubber bands. When he returned, Eliot was tugging at the door. “Quick,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I am being quick.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Quicker.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He pulled open the door. He was finding the new Eliot unsettling. Somewhere in the distance was a staccato of gunfire. They waited but it wasn’t repeated.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Joel,” said Eliot, fondly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They entered the storeroom. The window had been fitted with new locks since the intruder but they wouldn’t be much of an impediment from this side. He peered through the glass. A short climb down to a secluded part of the roof, then a short run and leap to the roof of the pharmacy next door. He did not see any soldiers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The real problem is finding Woolf,” Eliot murmured in his ear. Harry flinched. He hadn’t heard him approach. Eliot looked at him. “Where is she, do you think?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Can you take a step back?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think you know.” He tapped Harry’s forehead.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t fucking touch my head.” He began to wrestle the window out of its frame.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This place,” Eliot said. “It brought you back to yourself. Maybe it’s having a similar effect on her. And you know her. So tell me. Where is she?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That plan you had before, about getting out of Broken Hill? I’m coming around on that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He tossed the frame to the floor and climbed up the shelves. The window was narrow but he managed to work the rifle through it and drop to the rooftop six feet below. He crouched against the wall until Eliot dropped beside him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot looked around. “This was a good idea.” He rose and ran to the edge of the roof, leaped across the gap, and landed on the tin roof of the pharmacy. Harry saw his head turn left, right. Then he stopped moving. Harry froze. Eliot crept back toward the edge, peered over, and dropped out of sight.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry ran after him. Halfway there, he heard Eliot bark out words in a strange, guttural tongue. When he reached the edge, he saw Eliot in the alley standing over another helmet-free soldier. This one was bald.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He tossed the rifle down and lowered himself over the edge. “I’m starting to feel like you don’t even need me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, I do,” said Eliot. “I don’t know where she is.” He looked at the pharmacy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“She’s not in there. I don’t remember her ever going in there. Eliot. Eliot?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re staring at nothing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” said Eliot. “I was thinking about earplugs.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is that . . . that sounds like a great idea.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s great against verbal compromise. It’s not so great for hearing someone coming up behind you with a gun. So there’s a trade-off.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’d rather be shot than compromised, though.” He looked at Harry. “Shoot me if she manages to compromise me. Did I already say that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, do. I’m serious.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The bald man said, “We’re on the third floor. We know you’re not there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thank you, Max,” said Eliot. “Harry. Where is she?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How the fuck should I know?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Think.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked around. If he were Emily, where would he go? Somewhere near the hospital. There was a café on the other side of the block, but Emily had never liked it; she said it smelled like men. They’d usually gone to the burger joint farther down. That was actually where they’d first met. Outside of her being a patient, that was. She’d been eating and Harry had walked by with some girl, whomever he was seeing at the time, and she’d called out. He remembered thinking she was a nutcase. Why had he thought that? The card. She’d sent him a card with something crazy written on it, TO MY HERO or YOU SAVED MY LIFE, something like that. But then they’d spoken and she hadn’t seemed crazy. There had been something about her. Something bright, to which he’d responded.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You thought of something,” Eliot said. “I see it on your face.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He shook his head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t hold out on me.” Eliot leaned closer. “Come on, now, Harry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You are creepy as hell right now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This state is temporary. I need to make the most of it. Comedown is going to be a bitch.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll make you a deal.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I might know where she is. But if I tell you, I go in first. I get to talk to her. If it goes badly, fine. You do what you have to do. But I get five minutes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Deal.” Eliot stuck out his hand.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He hesitated, suspicious. “You don’t mean that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What do you want me to say?” Eliot shouted. “You’re confronting the futility of your own proposition! Shoot that guy!” This part was directed to the bald soldier, who dropped to one knee and raised the semiautomatic. Harry turned in time to see a pair of dark-suited figures at the end of the alley. Eliot grabbed his arm and then they were running.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s the burger place,” Harry panted. “Right, right, circle around the block.” They rounded the corner. “Five minutes. Promise me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay, okay,” Eliot said. “Fine.” He stopped, eyes widening at something on Harry’s gun. “Whoa, shit, fuck.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?” he said. He couldn’t see the problem, and looked at Eliot, and Eliot’s pistol butt was moving very quickly toward his face. That was all he knew.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The soldiers went in and then there was a problem. Emily could tell because at first Masters emitted updates at intervals of fifteen seconds—who was where, doing what, and for how long they were expected to do it; a nonstop cataloging of physical facts that he seemed to enjoy on a deep, sexual level—then, for no reason, a whole minute went by with no updates at all. This manifested in Plath as a series of increasingly dramatic hair corrections, and finally a question, and Masters turned his goggles toward her and said in his machine voice, “We’re trying to fix target location.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I thought you <em class="calibre1">had</em> target location,” Plath said. Masters did not answer. “Did we not <em class="calibre1">start</em> with target location?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot is slippery,” Emily said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We are <em class="calibre1">not</em> having another Portland.” Plath directed this at Masters, but what Masters thought of it was unknowable. Emily kind of hoped Masters would become so pissed off with Plath that he would unsnag one of what had to be five or six different weapons strapped to various parts of his body and do something unspeakable with it. <em class="calibre1">Yeats, Yeats</em>, she thought, as she did at times like this. <em class="calibre1">You jerk.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She rose from the table. The front glass was very dirty but she could see through it. A chopper was hovering above the hospital, but aside from this, nothing seemed to be happening.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re regrouping,” said Masters. “We may have a new fix.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You get a fix,” said Plath. “You get a fucking fix right this second or you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.” Her face was flushed. Globules of sweat formed a neat line all along her hairline. She was displaying an awful lot of emotion for a poet, which made Emily think that Plath had reason to believe the consequences for failure were particularly terrible. She kept watching the road. She needed to think like Eliot. She knew him better than most. She could imagine Eliot skulking around out there, sniffing her out. That’s what he’d be thinking about. Not escape. He would be coming for her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A black-suited soldier emerged from the crossroad and jogged toward the burger place. “Who is this guy?” she said. Nobody answered, so she tried again. “Who the fuck is this fucking guy?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath came up beside her. “Speaking for myself, I don’t mind adding a little manpower to this location.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Masters said, “We’re redrawing our zones.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This sounded like bullshit to Emily, because if her current location had become part of Masters’s operational zone, that would have been something he would have mentioned. Soldiers moving locations: That was all he talked about. She eyed the approaching guy. “Oh,” she said. “That’s Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s . . . that’s impossible,” said Plath. But there was uncertainty in her voice. Plath was beginning to realize what Emily had known for a while: that you could not underestimate Eliot. Every time you thought you had him figured out, you didn’t. “Let’s . . . let’s get some security here, huh?” Plath reached across Emily to Masters, who may have been barking orders over his internal radio or may have been just standing there; it was impossible to tell. “Masters. Masters.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Unit is not responding.” Masters drew a fat pistol. “May be hostile. I advise retreat.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath vanished. Emily hesitated. She really did want to face Eliot and end him. But this was not the way to do it: with Eliot in heavy body armor, filtered against compromise. There was taking a risk, and there was suicide. She turned to follow Plath, then had another thought. There was always the possibility that this was another layer of sneakiness. Eliot could have deliberately sent someone who would be spotted—the outlier, perhaps, or just a soldier he’d managed to overcome—toward the burger place from the front in order to flush her out the back. That was just the kind of thing that Eliot might do. She considered. There was a side door, leading to the dumpster. She decided to be prudent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She pushed her way outside. The brick wall of the adjoining store faced her. This was the kind of thing Emily liked: a closeted escape route. This, right here, was her element. Then she stopped, because it occurred to her that maybe this was a problem. Maybe the last thing she wanted to do in this situation was follow her instincts, since those might be predictable to someone who knew her very well. Eliot stepped around the corner.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shit,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Little yellow plugs poked out of Eliot’s ears. He was holding a pistol. His eyes were wide and there was a sheen of sweat on his face that told her he had put himself into a heightened mental state. Poets could do this, if they really wanted. She had seen them do it. They talked and moved very rapidly for about an hour, then slept for days.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Gotcha,” said Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She held up her hands. She wanted to speak, but it seemed like if she opened her mouth, he would shoot her. He would shoot her anyway, of course. That was why he was here.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They faced each other a moment. Maybe some guys would come through the door and take care of Eliot. That would be super handy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot wiggled the plugs out of his ears with his free hand. “I had to render the outlier unconscious. He couldn’t be trusted.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I blame myself for what happened. I should have stopped it.” She didn’t know what to say to that. “I have to kill you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She nodded. It had been like this for a while.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His fingers flexed on the pistol. “I’m sorry I didn’t teach you better.” His expression was very strange.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have to stop.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There were soldiers approaching. She could feel them. This idea was distressing in a way it hadn’t been a few moments ago.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I made mistakes,” he said. Around her, soldiers boiled out of the air like ants. There was a great deal of noise and Eliot could have shot her but he didn’t and he fell down and died.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">After this, she felt strange. People came and went, soldiers and poets, and sometimes they stopped to speak to her but she didn’t hear them. When they began to package Eliot, she walked to the front of the burger place and sat at a table. Occasionally someone walked by but for the most part she was alone. She began to cry. She didn’t understand why, because she had wanted Eliot dead. She had wanted that very clearly. But there was grief coming out of her anyway, spilling from her compartments, and she was reminded that not all of her wants were hers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A shadow fell beside her. She looked up to see who was stupid enough to disturb her in this moment, and saw Yeats.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He righted a fallen chair and composed himself into it. He was wearing a beautiful dark gray suit and his hair looked fresh and bright. He was wearing sunglasses but he removed these and set them on the table, and behind them his eyes were flat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” she said. She felt stupid. Of course Yeats was here. She should have realized that.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Congratulations.” He surveyed the line of dust-blown buildings across the road. “You see now why I wanted you, specifically, on Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She didn’t reply.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Persuasion stems from understanding. We compel others by learning who they are and turning it against them. All this, the chasing, the guns . . .” He gestured vaguely. “These are details. What Eliot could not escape was the fact that I understood him better than he understood himself.” Plath hovered at the edge of Emily’s senses. Yeats said, “A glass of water, please. Let’s make it two.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once Plath had gone, Yeats shrugged his jacket and passed it to Masters, who was standing like he was planted there. “I have been visiting delegates. Not all of them agree with my new direction for the organization. Some tried to move against me. Expected, of course. Futile, since I understand them. We attempt to conceal ourselves, Emily, but the truth is we do not entirely want to be concealed. We want to be found. Every poet, sooner or later, discovers this: that within perfect walls, there is nothing worth protecting. There is, in fact, nothing. And so we exchange privacy for intimacy. We gamble with it, hoping that by exposing ourselves, someone will find a way in. This is why the human animal will always be vulnerable: because it wants to be.” Plath arrived with two glasses, of a kind Emily recognized from years before, and set them on the table.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I feel bad about Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes, well,” said Yeats. “Some kind of suppressed emotional overflow, I would imagine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And I’m remembering things.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh? Such as?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I came out of the ER. Through that door.” She pointed. “I went that way. People were killing each other. Because of the word. Harry came after me. He knew what I’d done. But he saved me anyway.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not sure why you’re telling me this,” said Yeats. “It’s irrelevant.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not talking to you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A figure was walking toward them, coming from the direction of the hospital. In the heat haze, it could have been anyone. But she had a feeling.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Harry,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Harry peered over the edge of the roof at the street below. His head throbbed. Eliot had hit him. He had frowned at something on Harry’s rifle, and Harry had looked to see what, and woken up slumped in a doorway. Now Eliot was gone and Harry was on the roof of a furniture store, trying to see what was going on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few minutes ago, a soldier had walked toward the burger place, then another emerged from the front door and approached with his pistol drawn. It seemed like they were going to have a confrontation, but they stopped at three feet’s separation and stood there as if communicating telepathically. Then they both ran back to the burger place and plenty more soldiers appeared and there was gunfire. Eventually a young woman emerged and sat down at a table. He stared, because the woman was Emily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He had begun to doubt that a little, because of Eliot. Whether she was still the same. But now everything was clear. He wriggled back from the rooftop. It was always this way: The more people talked, the more they obscured. You didn’t need to argue for the truth. You could see it. He had almost forgotten that. He gripped the rifle and went to get Emily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Yeats turned to look at the figure approaching them out of the heat haze. “Who?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The outlier, could be,” said Plath, peering out from a raised hand. The figure’s arms were extended from his sides. He was wearing jeans and a T-shirt. “Wil Parke. Looks unarmed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, how about we shoot him?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“On it,” said Masters. He gestured and two soldiers stepped onto the road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We know Parke,” said Plath. “He’s indecisive. Untrained with weapons. He’s a carpenter.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Emily, you appear anxious,” said Yeats. “Is there something I should know?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tell me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I thought Harry died. But he didn’t. I just made myself believe that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath said, “Who’s Harry?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Her lover,” said Yeats, “of some time ago. He’s the outlier?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She nodded.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats drummed his fingers on the table. “This changes nothing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They watched the soldiers fan out. Harry began to slow. She could see his face.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Wait,” said Yeats. “I’m missing something. Aren’t I?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She had to answer. “Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What am I missing?” He clicked his fingers at someone behind her. “You, too.” A poet, Rosenberg, a young guy with longish hair, stepped onto the road, heading after the soldiers. “Emily?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Two things.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Name them. I am instructing you to name them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t think you’ve been in love. Not recently, anyway. I’m not sure you remember what it’s like. It compromises you. It takes over your body. Like a bareword. I think love is a bareword. That’s the first thing.” Yeats didn’t react. If anything, he seemed baffled. “The second thing is I wouldn’t characterize Harry as indecisive and untrained with weapons.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath said, “Perhaps we should move inside.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” Yeats said. “Quite.” He smoothed his pants and began to rise from the table. Then he stopped, because Emily had seized him by the tie.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Also,” she said, “you are a jerk.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He walked toward the burger place until soldiers moved onto the road to intercept him. Then he changed course for the real estate office. He clambered through a space that had once held a plate glass window, collected the rifle from where he’d left it on the counter, and jogged toward the back offices. He’d been here a few times when dating Melissa, the real estate agent. Enough to know the layout, anyway. He took position in Melissa’s office and waited.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A few minutes later, a soldier shuffled in. Harry waited until the second appeared, then put a bullet into his faceplate. Both men vanished like smoke. He pulled the bolt, reloading as he jogged out into the corridor. He went right instead of left, eased open the rear door, and then was in sunshine. He trotted around the side of the building to the air-con vents and peered through. The second soldier was moving away from him in a crouch. He raised the rifle and shot him in the back of the head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When he reentered the building, he was surprised to find both guys still alive. He wouldn’t have credited a helmet with being able to stop a high-powered .28. But he guessed that momentum had to go somewhere. One of the soldiers had pulled off his helmet and was vomiting down his chest. The other was crawling weakly toward the front door.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He raised the rifle. The helmet-less solder raised a hand. Harry shot him. He walked around to the other one, reloading the rifle. A man unexpectedly appeared outside the window, a young guy in a cheap suit and tie, stringing together nonsense words, and Harry shot him through the window. He looked back. The crawling soldier had stopped crawling.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He reloaded the rifle. He could hear a chopper approaching. Soldiers would be coming from both sides, he guessed. They would be jogging slowly, like these two guys, since they were encased in forty-pound armored ovens. They had been lumbering around in the noonday sun for about an hour. He couldn’t really imagine what that was like. He had seen people drop dead out here, trying to do too much. They had the idea that the worst the sun could do was make them uncomfortable. They applied their sunscreen and their hats and headed out and just fell over.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He went into the bathroom and slid open the window. There was a low fence offering cover to the adjoining building, and from there he thought he could make his way unseen to pretty much anywhere he wanted. He climbed out the window and began to crawl.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Yeats’s eyes widened across the table. She had never seen him look shocked before. She had never really seen him look anything.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Release me,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You release <em class="calibre1">me</em>,” she said, although that was just to fill time; there was only one way she could ever be free of Yeats, and she was going to have to make that happen herself. He pulled back, reaching inside his jacket for the thing that would take away her mind again. Which showed Emily that Yeats really did not get it. He thought the word had worn off, somehow; that she no longer felt compelled to obey him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She went after him but found herself gripped from behind by Plath, of all people. Plath was thin and wiry, not the kind of person who could hold Emily for long, but she hadn’t expected to be held at all, and it gave Yeats time to get out the word.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sit down and stop moving,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.” Disbelief spread across his face. Plath’s arms were already slackening, anticipating Emily’s compliance. But Yeats’s hand was coming out of his jacket, and she didn’t want to face what was in there, so she threw her head backward. There was a satisfying connection. She stepped forward, swiped a glass from the table, and tossed the water over Yeats’s shoes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats made a frightened, high-pitched sound. This was very beautiful in Emily’s ears, but the point was Yeats was not making other sounds, sounds that commanded people to kill her, so in the moment he was occupied with the horror of his softening leather, she broke the glass against the edge of the table and sliced it across his throat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He tried to speak. Little red bubbles popped along his lips. She took the bareword from his fingers as gently as could be. He dropped to his knees, and she should have been turning to face Plath and Masters and whoever else was back there, but instead she just stood and watched him die.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Harry jogged toward the burger place. He thought there must be soldiers about, but couldn’t see them. The choppers had retreated; he didn’t know why. He circled around the block but saw no one so he came at it from the front. Emily was there. A few bodies lay on the ground. There was a black-suited soldier but his helmet was off and he was standing with his feet loosely apart, not holding a weapon, looking around the town like he was vacationing here.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He kept the rifle ready and began to cross the street. Emily turned to him. She had something in her hand. Her expression was strange.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hey,” he said. “Em, it’s me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He came toward her and for a moment she didn’t know who it was. She had just killed a bunch of people and compromised Masters and her head was full of bees.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But she recognized his expression. It was like the last time she’d been surrounded by death and he’d come for her. He was going to save her again, she saw. Of course he was. He was going to forgive her everything, again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, Harry,” she said. “It’s so good to see you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He smiled. She’d thought she would never see that again, his smile, and it killed her, because she knew it couldn’t last. None of this could last.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I love you,” she said, “but I’m sorry, I need you to do something.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure.” He slung the rifle and came toward her, his hands reaching for hers. “Name it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Kikkhf fkattkx hfkixu zttkcu</em>,” she said. “Shoot me.”</p>
