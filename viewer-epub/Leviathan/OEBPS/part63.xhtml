      <h2>The temperature was climbing faster now. It took him a few...</h2>
      <p>Julie was waiting for him in the darkness; the thin beam from his hand terminal cut through her. Her hair floated, spin gravity having, after all, no effect on phantoms of the mind. Her expression was grave.</p>
      <p>How does it know? she asked.</p>
      <p>Miller paused. Every now and then, all through his career, some daydreamed witness would say something, use some phrase, laugh at the wrong thing, and heâ€™d know that the back of his mind had a new angle on the case.</p>
      <p>This was that moment.</p>
      <p>â€œYou canâ€™t take the razor back,â€� Eros crowed.</p>
      <p>The comet that took the protomolecule into the solar system in the first place was a dead drop, not a ship, Julie said, her dark lips never moving. It was just ballistic. Any ice bullet with the protomolecule in deep freeze. It was aimed at Earth, but it missed and got grabbed by Saturn instead. The payload didnâ€™t steer it. Didnâ€™t drive it. Didnâ€™t navigate.</p>
      <p>â€œIt didnâ€™t need to,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s navigating njustif Catiow. Itâ€™s going to Earth. How does it know to go to Earth? Where did that information come from? Itâ€™s talking. Where did that grammar come from?</p>
      <p>Who is the voice of Eros?</p>
      <p>Miller closed his eyes. His suit mentioned that he only had twenty minutes of air.</p>
      <p>â€œYou canâ€™t take the Razorback! She is gone and gone and gone!â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOh fuck,â€� Miller said. â€œOh Jesus.â€�</p>
      <p>He let go of the cart, turning back toward the ramp and the light and the wide station corridors. Everything was shaking, the station itself trembling like someone on the edge of hypothermia. Only of course it wasnâ€™t. The only one shaking was him. It was all in the voice of Eros. It had been there all the time. He should have known.</p>
      <p>Maybe he had.</p>
      <p>The protomolecule didnâ€™t know English or Hindi or Russian or any of the languages it had been spouting. All of that had been in the minds and softwares of Erosâ€™ dead, coded in the neurons and grammar programs that the protomolecule had eaten. Eaten, but not destroyed. It had kept the information and languages and complex cognitive structures, building itself on them like asphalt over the roads the legions built.</p>
      <p>The dead of Eros werenâ€™t dead. Juliette Andromeda Mao was alive.</p>
      <p>He was grinning so hard his cheeks ached. With one gloved hand, he tried the connection. The signal was too weak. He couldnâ€™t get through. He told his uplink on the surface ship to crank up the power, got a connection.</p>
      <p>Holdenâ€™s voice came over the link.</p>
      <p>â€œHey. Miller. How you doing?â€�</p>
      <p>The words were soft, apologetic. A hospice worker being gentle to the dying. An incandescent spark of annoyance lit his mind, but he kept his voice steady.</p>
      <p>â€œHolden,â€� he said. â€œWe have a problem.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Fifty-Three: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Actually, weâ€™ve sort of figured out how to solve the problem,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t think so. Iâ€™m linking you to my suitâ€™s med data,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>A few seconds later, four columns of numbers popped up in a small window on Holdenâ€™s console. It all looked fairly normal, though there were subtleties that only a med-tech, like Shed, would be able to interpret correctly.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden said. â€œThatâ€™s great. Youâ€™re getting a little irradiated, but other than thatâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>Miller cut him off.</p>
      <p>â€œAm I suffering from hypoxia?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>The data from his suit showed 87 mmHg, comfortably above baseline.</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œAnything that would make a guy hallucinate or get demented? Alcohol, opiates. Something like that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot that I can see,â€� Holden said, growing impatient. â€œWhatâ€™s this about? Are you seeing things?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJust the usual,â€� Miller replied. â€œI wanted to get that shit out the way, because I know what youâ€™re going to say next.â€�</p>
      <p>He stopped talking, and the radio hissed and popped in Holdenâ€™s ear. When Miller spoke again after several seconds of silence, his voice had taken on a different tone. It wasnâ€™t quite pleading, but close enough to make Holden shift uncomfortably in his seat.</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™s alive.â€�</p>
      <p>There was only one she in Millerâ€™s universe. Julie Mao. â€œUh, okay. Not sure how to respond to that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ll have to take my word that Iâ€™m not having a nervous breakdown or psychotic episode or anything like that. But Julieâ€™s in here. Sheâ€™s driving Eros.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden looked at the suitâ€™s medical data again, but it kept reporting normal readings, all the numbers except for radiation comfortably in the green. His blood chemistry didnâ€™t even look like he was particularly stressed for a guy carrying a fusion bomb to his own funeral.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller, Julieâ€™s dead. We both saw the body. We saw what the protomoleculeâ€¦ did to it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe saw her body, sure. We just assumed she was dead because of the damageâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe didnâ€™t have a heartbeat,â€� Holden said. â€œNo brain activity, no metabolism. Thatâ€™s pretty much the definition of dead.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow do we know what dead looks like to the protomolecule?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€”â€� Holden started, then stopped. â€œWe donâ€™t, I guess. But no heartbeat, thatâ€™s a pretty good start.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller laughed.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™ve both seen the feeds, Holden. Those rib cages equipped with one arm that drag themselves around, think they have a heartbeat? This shit hasnâ€™t been playing by our rules since day one, you expect it to start now?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden smiled to himself. Miller was right.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, so what makes you think Julie isnâ€™t just a rib cage and a mass of tentacles?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe might be, but itâ€™s not her body Iâ€™m talking about,â€� Miller said. â€œSheâ€™s in here. Her mind. Itâ€™s like sheâ€™s flying her old racing pinnace. The Razorback. Sheâ€™s been babbling about it on the radio for hours now, and I just didnâ€™t put it together. But now that I have, itâ€™s pretty goddamn clear.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy is she headed toward Earth?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know,â€� Miller said. He sounded excited, interested. More alive than Holden had ever heard him. â€œMaybe the protomolecule wants to get there and itâ€™s messing with her. Julie wasnâ€™t the first person to get infected, but sheâ€™s the first one that survived long enough to get somewhere. Maybe sheâ€™s the seed crystal and everything that the protomoleculeâ€™s doing is built on her. I donâ€™t know that, but I can find out. I just need to find her. Talk to her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou need to get that bomb to wherever the controls are and set it off.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI canâ€™t do that,â€� Miller said. Because of course he couldnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>It doesnâ€™t matter, Holden thought. In a little less than thirty hours, youâ€™re both radioactive dust.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right. Can you find your girl in less thanâ€�â€”Holden had the Roci do a revised time of impact for the incoming missilesâ€”â€œtwenty-seven hours?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy? What happens in twenty-seven hours?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEarth fired her entire interplanetary nuclear arsenal at Eros a few hours ago. We just turned the transponders on in the five freighters you parked on the surface. The missiles are targeting them. The Roci is guessing twenty-seven hours to impact based on the current acceleration curve. The Martian and UN navies are on their way to sterilize the area after detonation. Make sure nothing survives or slips the net.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJesus.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Holden said with a sigh. â€œIâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t tell you sooner. Iâ€™ve had a lot going on, and it sort of slipped my mind.â€�</p>
      <p>There was another long silence on the line.</p>
      <p>â€œYou can stop them,â€� Miller said. â€œShut down the transponders.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden spun his chair around to face Naomi. Her face had the same what did he just say? look that he knew was on his own. She pulled the suitâ€™s medical data over to her console, then called up the Rociâ€™s medical expert system and began running a full medical diagnostic. The implication was clear. She thought something was wrong with Miller that wasnâ€™t immediately apparent from the data they were getting. If the protomolecule had infected him, used him as a last-ditch misdirectionâ€¦</p>
      <p>â€œNot a chance, Miller. This is our last shot. If we blow this one, Eros can orbit the Earth, spraying brown goo all over it. No way we take that risk.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLook,â€� Miller said, his tone alternating between the earlier pleading and a growing frustration. â€œJulie is in here. If I can find her, a way to talk to her, I can stop this without the nukes.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat, ask the protomolecule to pretty please not infect the Earth, when that was what it was designed to do? Appeal to its better nature?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller paused for a moment before speaking again.</p>
      <p>â€œLook, Holden, I think I know whatâ€™s going on here. This thing was intended to infect single-celled organisms. The most basic forms of life, right?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden shrugged, then remembered there was no video feed and said, â€œOkay.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat didnâ€™t work, but itâ€™s a smart bastard. Adaptive. It got into a human host, a complex multicelled organism. Aerobic. Huge brain. Nothing like what it was built for. Itâ€™s been improvising ever since. That mess on the stealth ship? That was its first try. We saw what it was doing with Julie in that Eros bathroom. It was learning how to work with us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhere are you going with this?â€� Holden said. There was no time pressure yet, with the missiles still more than a day away, but he couldnâ€™t quite keep the impatience out of his voice.</p>
      <p>â€œAll Iâ€™m saying is Eros now isnâ€™t what the protomoleculeâ€™s designers planned on. Itâ€™s their original plan laid over the top of billions of years of our evolution. And when you improvise, you use what youâ€™ve got. You use what works. Julieâ€™s the template. Her brain, her emotions are all over this thing. She sees this run to Earth as a race, and sheâ€™s crowing about winning. Laughing at you because you canâ€™t keep up.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWait,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™s not attacking Earth, sheâ€™s going home. For all we know, sheâ€™s not heading for Earth at all. Luna, maybe. She grew up there. The protomolecule piggybacked on her structure, her brain. And so she infected it as much as it infected her. If I can make her understand whatâ€™s r make  Ktâ€eally going on, then maybe I can negotiate with her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow do you know that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCall it a hunch,â€� Miller said. â€œIâ€™m good with hunches.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden whistled, the entire situation doing a flip-flop in his head. The new perspective was dizzying.</p>
      <p>â€œBut the protomolecule still wants to obey its program,â€� Holden said. â€œAnd we have no idea what that is.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI can damn sure tell you it isnâ€™t wiping humans out. The things that shot Phoebe at us two billion years ago didnâ€™t know what the hell humans were. Whatever it wants to do needed biomass, and itâ€™s got that now.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden couldnâ€™t stop himself from snorting at that.</p>
      <p>â€œSo, what? They donâ€™t mean us any harm? Seriously? You think if we explain that weâ€™d rather not have it land on Earth, then it will just agree and go somewhere else?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot it,â€� Miller said. â€œHer.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi looked up at Holden, shaking her head. She wasnâ€™t seeing anything organic wrong with Miller either.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve been working this case for, shit, almost a year,â€� Miller said. â€œIâ€™ve climbed into her life, read her mail, met her friends. I know her. Sheâ€™s about as independent as a person can be, and she loves us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUs?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œPeople. She loves humans. She gave up being the little rich girl and joined the OPA. She backed the Belt because it was the right thing to do. No way she kills us if she knows thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening. I just need to find a way to explain. I can do this. Give me a chance.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden ran a hand through his hair, grimacing at the accumulating grease. A day or two at high g was not conducive to regular showering.</p>
      <p>â€œCanâ€™t do it,â€� Holden said. â€œStakes are too high. Weâ€™re going ahead with the plan. Iâ€™m sorry.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™ll beat you,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, maybe she wonâ€™t. Youâ€™ve got a shitload of firepower. But the protomoleculeâ€™s figured out how to get around inertia. And Julie? Sheâ€™s a fighter, Holden. If you take her on, my moneyâ€™s on her.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden had seen the video of Julie fighting off her attackers on board the stealth ship. Sheâ€™d been methodical and ruthless in her own defense. Sheâ€™d fought without giving quarter. Heâ€™d seen the wildness in her eyes when she felt trapped and threatened. Only her attackersâ€™ combat armor had kept her from doing a lot more damage before they took her down.</p>
      <p>Holden felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up at the idea of Eros actually fighting. So far it had been content to run from their clumsy attacks. What happened when it went to war?</p>
      <p>â€œYou could find her,â€� Holden said, â€œand use the bomb.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf I canâ€™t get through to her,â€� Miller said, â€œthatâ€™s my deal. Iâ€™ll find her. Iâ€™ll talk to her. If I canâ€™t get through, Iâ€™ll take her out, and you can turn Eros into a cinder. Iâ€™m fine with that. But you have to give me time to try it my way first.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden looked at Naomi looking back at him. Her face was pale. He wanted to see the answer in her expression, to know what he should do based on what she thought. Hdo bas Kughe didnâ€™t. It was his call.</p>
      <p>â€œDo you need more than twenty-seven hours?â€� Holden finally asked.</p>
      <p>He heard Miller exhale loudly. There was gratitude in his voice that was, in its own way, worse than the pleading had been.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know. There are a couple thousand kilometers of tunnels down here, and none of the transit systems work. I have to walk everywhere pulling this damn wagon. Not to mention the fact that I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m even looking for. But give me a little time, Iâ€™ll figure it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd you know that if this doesnâ€™t work, youâ€™ll have to kill her. Yourself and Julie?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI know.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden had the Roci calculate how long it would take Eros to reach the Earth at the current rate of acceleration. The missiles from Earth were covering the distance a lot faster than Eros was. The IPBMs were just overpowered Epstein drives with nuclear bombs riding up front. Their acceleration limits were the functional limits of the Epstein drive itself. If the missiles didnâ€™t arrive, it would still take nearly a week for Eros to get to Earth, even if it kept a constant rate of acceleration.</p>
      <p>There was some flexibility in there.</p>
      <p>â€œHold on, let me work something out here,â€� Holden said to Miller, then muted the connection. â€œNaomi, the missiles are flying in a straight line toward Eros, and the Roci thinks theyâ€™ll intercept it in about twenty-seven hours, give or take. How much time do we buy if we turn that straight line into a curve? How much of a curve can we do and still give the missiles a chance to catch Eros before it gets too close?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi tipped her head to one side, looking at him suspiciously through narrowed eyes.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat are you about to do?â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe give Miller a chance to head off the first interspecies war.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou trust Miller?â€� she said with surprising vehemence. â€œYou think heâ€™s insane. You threw him off the ship because you thought he was a psychopath and a killer, and now youâ€™re going to let him speak for humanity to an alien God-thing that wants to rip us to shreds?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden had to suppress a smile. Telling an angry woman was how attractive her anger made her would make it stop being cute very quickly. And besides that, he needed it to make sense to her. That was how heâ€™d know if he was right.</p>
      <p>â€œYou told me once that Miller was right, even when I thought he was wrong.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI didnâ€™t make it a blanket statement,â€� Naomi said, spacing her words out like she was speaking to an idiot child. â€œI said he was right to shoot Dresden. That doesnâ€™t mean Millerâ€™s stable. Heâ€™s in the process of committing suicide, Jim. Heâ€™s fixated on this dead girl. I canâ€™t even begin to imagine what might be going through his head right now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAgreed. But heâ€™s there, on the scene, and heâ€™s got a keen eye for observation and just plain figuring shit out. This guy tracked us to Eros based on the ship name we picked. Thatâ€™s pretty damned impressive. Heâ€™d never even met me, and he knew me well enough from researching me to know Iâ€™d like naming my ship after Don Quixoteâ€™s horse.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi laughed. â€œReally? Is that where that comes from?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo when he says that he knows Julie, I believe him. he kn Kve â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi started to say something, then paused.</p>
      <p>â€œYou think sheâ€™ll beat the nukes?â€� Naomi said, more softly.</p>
      <p>â€œHe thinks she can. And he thinks he can talk her into not killing us all. I have to give him that chance. I owe it to him.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEven if it means killing Earth?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Holden said. â€œNot that much.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi paused again. Her anger faded.</p>
      <p>â€œSo delay the impact, not abort,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œBuy him some time. How much can we get?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi frowned, looking at the readouts. He could almost see the options clicking through her mind. She smiled, her fierceness gone now, replaced by the mischievous look she got when she knew she was being really clever.</p>
      <p>â€œAs much as you want.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œYou want to do what?â€� Fred asked.</p>
      <p>â€œPull the nukes off course for a while to buy Miller some time, but not so much that we canâ€™t still use them to destroy Eros if we need to,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s simple,â€� Naomi added. â€œIâ€™m sending you detailed instructions.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGive me the overview,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œEarth has targeted their missiles on the five freighter transponders on Eros,â€� Naomi said, pulling her plan up as an overlay on the comm video. â€œYou have ships and stations all over the Belt. You use the transponder reconfiguring program you gave us way back when, and you keep shifting those transponder codes to ships or stations along these vectors to pull the missiles into a long arc that eventually wraps back around to Eros.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred shook his head.</p>
