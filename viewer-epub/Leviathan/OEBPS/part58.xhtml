      <h2>â€œIf that science ship starts flying toward Eros again, I...</h2>
      <p>Naomi smiled at him, then grabbed his flight suit and pulled him close enough for a kiss.</p>
      <p>â€œYou might be the best person I know. But youâ€™re totally uncompromising on what you think is right, and thatâ€™s what you hate about Miller.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI do?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes,â€� she said. â€œHeâ€™s totally uncompromising too, but he has different ideas on how things work. You hate that. To Miller, Dresden was an active threat to the ship. Every second he stayed alive endangered everyone else around him. To Miller, it was self-defense.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBut heâ€™s wrong. The man was helpless.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe man talked the UN Navy into giving his company state-of-the-art ships,â€� she said. â€œHe talked his company into murdering a million and a half people. Everything Miller said about why the protomolecule is better off with us was just as true about Dresden. How long is he in an OPA lockup before he finds the jailer who can be bought?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe was a prisoner,â€� Holden said, feeing the argument slipping away from him.</p>
      <p>â€œHe was a monster with power, access, and allies who would have paid any price to keep his science project going,â€� Naomi said. â€œAnd Iâ€™m telling you as a Belter, Miller wasnâ€™t wrong.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden didnâ€™t answer; he just continued to float next to Naomi, keeping himself in her orbit. Was he angrier about the killing of Dresden or about Millerâ€™s making a decision that disagreed with him?</p>
      <p>ign=“justify”>And Miller had known. When Holden had told him to find his own ride back to Tycho, heâ€™d seen it in the detectiveâ€™s sad basset hound face. Miller had known it was coming, and had made no attempt to fight or argue. That meant that Miller had made his choice fully cognizant of the cost and ready to pay it. That meant something. Holden wasnâ€™t sure exactly what, but something.</p>
      <p>A red telltale began flashing on the wall, and Naomiâ€™s panel woke up and began throwing data onto the screen. She pulled herself down to it using the back of her chair, then tapped out several quick commands.</p>
      <p>â€œShit,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat is it?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe corvette or science ship must have called for help,â€� Naomi said, pointing at her screen. â€œWeâ€™ve got ships on their way from all over the system.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow many are coming?â€� Holden asked, trying to get a better look at her screen.</p>
      <p>Naomi made a small sound in the back of her throat, halfway between a chuckle and a cough.</p>
      <p>â€œAt a guess? All of them.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Forty-Eight: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>You are, and you arenâ€™t,â€� the Eros feed said through a semi-random drumming of static. â€œYou are, and you arenâ€™t. You are, and you arenâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>The little ship shuddered and bumped. From a crash couch, one of the OPA techs called out a string of obscenities remarkable more for inventiveness than actual rancor. Miller closed his eyes, trying to keep the micro-g adjustments of their nonstandard docking from nauseating him. After days of joint-aching acceleration and an equally bruising braking routine, the small shifts and movements felt arbitrary and strange.</p>
      <p>â€œYou are, are, are, are, are, are, areâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>Heâ€™d spent some time listening to the newsfeeds. Three days after theyâ€™d left Tycho, the news of Protogenâ€™s involvement with Eros broke. Amazingly, Holden hadnâ€™t been the one to do it. Since then, the corporation had gone from total denial, to blaming a rogue subcontractor, to claiming immunity under an Earth defense secrets statute. It didnâ€™t sound good for them. Earthâ€™s blockade of Mars was still in place, but attention had shifted to the power struggle within Earth, and the Martian navy had slowed its burn, giving the Earth forces a little more breathing room before any permanent decisions had to be made. It looked like theyâ€™d postponed Armageddon for a few weeks, anyway. Miller found he could take a certain joy in that. It also left him tired.</p>
      <p>More often, he listened to the voice of Eros. Sometimes he watched the video feeds too, but usually, he just listened. Over the hours and days, he began to hear, if not patterns, at least common structures. Some of the voices spooling out of the dying station were consistentâ€”broadcasters and entertainers who were overrepresented in the audio files archives, he guessed. There seemed to be some specific tendencies in, for want of a better term, the music of it too. Hours of random, fluting static and snatched bits of phrases would give way, and Eros would latch on to some word or phrase, fixating on it with greater and greater intensity until it broke apart and the randomness poured back in.</p>
      <p>â€œâ€¦ are, are, are, ARE, ARE, AREâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>Arenâ€™t, Miller thought, and the ship > Mill th…suddenly shoved itself up, leaving Millerâ€™s stomach about half a foot from where it had been. A series of loud clanks followed, and then the brief wail of a Klaxon.</p>
      <p>â€œDieu! Dieu!â€� someone shouted. â€œBombs son vamen roja! Going to fry it! Fry us toda!â€�</p>
      <p>There was the usual polite chuckle that the same joke had occasioned over the course of the trip, and the boy whoâ€™d made itâ€”a pimply Belter no more than fifteen years oldâ€”grinned with pleasure at his own wit. If he didnâ€™t stop that shit, someone was going to beat him with a crowbar before they got back to Tycho. But Miller figured that someone wasnâ€™t him.</p>
      <p>A massive jolt forward pushed him hard into the couch, and then gravity was back, the familiar 0.3 g. Maybe a little more. Except that with the airlocks pointing toward shipâ€™s down, the pilot had to grapple the spinning skin of Erosâ€™ belly first. The spin gravity made what had been the ceiling the new floor; the lowest rank of couches was now the top; and while they rigged the fusion bombs to the docks, they were all going to have to climb up onto a cold, dark rock that was trying to fling them off into the vacuum.</p>
      <p>Such were the joys of sabotage.</p>
      <p>Miller suited up. After the military-grade suits of the Rocinante, the OPAâ€™s motley assortment of equipment felt like third-hand clothes. His suit smelled of someone elseâ€™s body, and the Mylar faceplate had a deformation where it had cracked and been repaired. He didnâ€™t like thinking about what had happened to the poor bastard whoâ€™d been wearing it. The magnetic boots had a thick layer of corroded plastic and old mud between the plates and a triggering mechanism so old that Miller could feel it click on and off even before he moved his foot. He had the image of the suit locking on to Eros and never letting go.</p>
      <p>The thought made him smile. You belong with me, his own private Julie had said. It was true, and now that he was here, he felt perfectly certain that he wasnâ€™t going to leave. Heâ€™d been a cop for too long, and the idea of trying to reconnect to humanity again filled him with the presentiment of exhaustion. He was here to do the last part of his job. And then he was done.</p>
      <p>â€œOi! Pampaw!â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m coming,â€� Miller said. â€œHold your damn horses. Itâ€™s not like the stationâ€™s going anyplace.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œA rainbow is a circle you canâ€™t see. Canâ€™t see. Canâ€™t see,â€� Eros said in a childâ€™s singsong voice. Miller turned down the volume of his feed.</p>
      <p>The rocky surface of the station had no particular purchase for the suits and control waldoes. Two other ships had made polar landings where there was no spin gravity to fight against, but the Coriolis would leave everyone with a subliminal nausea. Millerâ€™s team had to keep to the exposed metal plates of the dock, clinging like flies looking down into the starlit abyss.</p>
      <p>Engineering the placement of the fusion bombs wasnâ€™t trivial work. If the bombs didnâ€™t pump enough energy into the station, the surface might cool enough to give someone another chance to put a science team on it before the penumbra of the sun swallowed it and whatever parts of the Nauvoo were still clinging to it. Even with the best minds of Tycho, there was still the chance that the detonations wouldnâ€™t sync up. If the pressure waves traveling through the rock amplified in ways they hadnâ€™t anticipated, the station could crack open like an egg, spreading the protomolecule through the wide, empty track of the solar system like scattering a handful of dust. But the difference between success and diffeurfss and  disaster might be literally a question of meters.</p>
      <p>Miller crawled up the airlock and out to the station surface. The first wave of technicians were setting up resonance seismographs, the glow of the work lights and readouts the brightest thing in the universe. Miller set his boots on a wide swath of a ceramic steel alloy and let the spin stretch the kinks out of his back. After days in the acceleration couch, the freedom felt euphoric. One of the techs raised her hands, the physical Belter idiom that called for attention. Miller upped the suit volume.</p>
      <p>â€œâ€¦ insectes rampant sur ma peauâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>With a stab of impatience, he switched from the Eros feed to the team channel.</p>
      <p>â€œGot to move,â€� a womanâ€™s voice said. â€œToo much splashback here. We have to get to the other side of the docks.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThese go on for almost two kilometers,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œIs,â€� she agreed. â€œWe can unmoor and move the ship under power or we can tow it. Weâ€™ve got enough lead line.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhich oneâ€™s fastest? We donâ€™t have a lot of spare time here.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTowing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTow it, then,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Slowly, the ship rose, twenty small, crawling transport drones clinging to leads like they were hauling a great metallic zeppelin. The ship was going to stay with him, here on the station, strapped to the rock like a sacrifice to the gods. Miller walked with the crew as they crossed the wide, closed bay doors. The only sounds were the tapping of his soles as the electromagnets jolted onto the surface and then a tick when they let go again. The only smells were of his own body and the fresh plastic of the air recycler. The metal under his feet shone like someone had cleaned it. Any dust or pebbles had been hurled away long ago.</p>
      <p>They worked fast to place the ship, arm the bombs, and fit the security codes, everyone tacitly aware of the great missile that had been the Nauvoo speeding toward them.</p>
      <p>If another ship came down and tried to disarm the trap, the ship would send synchronizing signals to all the other OPA bomb ships studding the moonâ€™s surface. Three seconds later, the surface of Eros would be scrubbed clean. The spare air and supplies were loaded off the ship, bundled together and ready for reclamation. No reason to waste the resources.</p>
      <p>Nothing horrific crawled out of an airlock and tried to attack the crew, which made Millerâ€™s presence during the mission entirely superfluous. Or maybe not. Maybe it was just a ride.</p>
      <p>When everything was done that could be, Miller sent the all clear, relayed through the now-dead shipâ€™s system. The return transport appeared slowly, a dot of light that grew gradually brighter and then spread, the null-g boarding web strung out like scaffolding. At the new shipâ€™s word, Millerâ€™s team turned off their boots and fired simple maneuvering thrusters either from their suits or, if the suits were too old, from shared ablative evacuation shells. Miller watched them drop away.</p>
      <p>â€œCall va and roll, Pampaw,â€� Diogo said from someplace. Miller wasnâ€™t sure which of them he was at this distance. â€œThis tube donâ€™t sit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not coming,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œSa que?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI decided. Iâ€™m staying here.â€�</p>
      <p>There was a moment n="juserâoment nof silence. Miller had been waiting for this. He had the security codes. If he needed to crawl back into the shell of their old ship and lock the door behind him, he could. But he didnâ€™t want to. Heâ€™d prepared his arguments: He would only be going back to Tycho as a political pawn for Fred Johnsonâ€™s negotiations; he was tired and old in a way that years didnâ€™t describe; heâ€™d already died on Eros once, and he wanted to be here to finish it. Heâ€™d earned that much. Diogo and the others owed it to him.</p>
      <p>He waited for the boy to react, to try to talk him out of it.</p>
      <p>â€œAll correct, then,â€� Diogo said. â€œBuona morte.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBuona morte,â€� Miller said, and shut off his radio. The universe was silent. The stars below him shifted slowly but perceptibly as the station he hung from spun. One of those lights was the Rocinante. Two others were the ships Holden had been sent out to stall. Miller couldnâ€™t pick them out. Julie floated beside him, her dark hair floating in the vacuum, the stars shining through her. She looked peaceful.</p>
      <p>If you had it to do again, she said. If you could do it all over from the beginning?</p>
      <p>â€œI wouldnâ€™t,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>He watched the OPA transport ship start up its engines, glowing gold and white, and pull away until it was a star again. A small one. And then lost. Miller turned and considered the dark, empty moonscape and the permanent night.</p>
      <p>He just needed to be with her for another few hours, and they would both be safe. They would all be safe. It was enough. Miller found himself smiling and weeping, the tears tracking up from his eyes and into his hair.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s going to be fine, Julie said.</p>
      <p>â€œI know,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>He stood silently for almost an hour, then turned and made his slow, precarious way back to the sacrificed ship, down the airlock, and into the dim belly. There was enough residual atmosphere that he didnâ€™t need to sleep in his suit. He stripped naked, chose an acceleration couch, and curled up on the hard blue gel. Not twenty meters away, five fusion devices powerful enough to outshine the sun waited for a signal. Above him, everything that had once been human in Eros Station changed and re-formed, pouring from one shape to another like Hieronymous Bosch made real. And still almost a day away, the Nauvoo, the hammer of God, hurtled toward him.</p>
      <p>Miller set his suit to play some old pop tunes heâ€™d enjoyed when he was young and let himself be sung to sleep. When he dreamed, he dreamed heâ€™d found a tunnel at the back of his old hole on Ceres that meant he would at last, at last, be free.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>His last breakfast was a hard kibble bar and a handful of chocolate scrounged from a forgotten survival pack. He ate it with tepid recycled water that tasted of iron and rot. The signals from Eros were almost drowned by the oscillating frequencies blasting out from the station above him, but Miller made out enough to know where things stood.</p>
      <p>Holden had won, much as Miller had expected him to. The OPA was responding to a thousand angry accusations from Earth and Mars and, in the true and permanent style, factions within the OPA itself. It was too late. The Nauvoo was due in hours now. The end was coming.</p>
      <p>Miller put on his suit for fy">Mi ant for fthe last time, turned out the lights, and crawled back up the airlock. For a long moment, the exterior release didnâ€™t respond, the safety lights glowing red, and he had a stab of fear that he would spend his last moments there, trapped in a tube like a torpedo ready to fire. But he cycled the lockâ€™s power, and it opened.</p>
      <p>The Eros feed was wordless now, with only a soft murmuring like water over stone. Miller walked out across the wide mouth of the docking bays. The sky above him turned, and the Nauvoo rose from the horizon like sun. His splayed hand held at full armâ€™s length wasnâ€™t big enough to cover the glow of its engines. He hung by his boots, watching the ship approach. The phantom Julie watched with him.</p>
