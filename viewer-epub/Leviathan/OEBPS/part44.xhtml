      <h2>They were silent for a long moment. Holden spoke first.</h2>
      <p>â€œSo you take a company that seems to be lacking an institutional conscience, that has enough government research contracts to almost be a privately run branch of the military. How far will they go for the holy grail?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFirst, fastest, furthest,â€� Miller replied.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGuys,â€� Naomi said, â€œyou should come down here. I think Iâ€™ve got something.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Thirty-Five: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Iâ€™ve found the comm logs,â€� Naomi said as Holden and Miller drifted into the room behind her.</p>
      <p>Holden put a hand on her shoulder, pulled it back, and hated that heâ€™d pulled back. A week earlier sheâ€™d have been fine with a simple gesture of affection like that, and he wouldnâ€™t have been afraid of her reaction. He regretted the new distance between them only slightly less than he would have regretted not saying anything at all. He wanted to tell her that.</p>
      <p>Instead, he said, â€œFind anything good?â€�</p>
      <p>She tapped the screen and pulled up the log.</p>
      <p>â€œThey were hard-core about comm discipline,â€� she said, pointing at the long list of dates and times. â€œNothing ever went out on radio, everything was tightbeam. And everything was doublespeak, lots of obvious code phrases.â€�</p>
      <p>Millerâ€™s mouth moved inside his helmet. Holden tapped on his face shield. Miller rolled his eyes in disgust and then chinned the comm link to the general channel.</p>
      <p>â€œSorry. Donâ€™t spend a lot of time in suits,â€� he said. â€œWhatâ€™ve we got thatâ€™s good?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot much. But the last communication was in plain English,â€� she said, then tapped the last line on the list.</p>
      <p>THOTH STATION Â  CREW DEGENERATING. PROJECTING 100% CASUALTIES. MATERIALS SECURED. STABILIZING COURSE AND SPEED. VECTOR DATA TO FOLLOW. EXTREME CONTAMINATION HAZARD FOR ENTRY TEAMS.CPT. HIGGINS</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Holden read it several times, imagining Captain Higgins watching the infection spread through his crew, helpless to stop it. His people vomiting all over in a vacuum-sealed metal box, even one molecule of the substance on your skin a virtual death sentence. Black filament-covered tendrils erupting from their eyes and mouths. And then thatâ€¦ soup that covered the reactor. He let himself shudder, grateful that Miller wouldnâ€™t see it through the atmosphere suit.</p>
      <p>â€œSo this Higgins fella realizes his crew is turning into vomit zombies and sends a last message to his bosses, right?â€� Miller said, breaking into Holdenâ€™s reverie. â€œWhatâ€™s this stuff about vector data?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe knew theyâ€™d all be dead, so he was letting his people know how to catch the ship,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>â€œBut they didnâ€™t, because itâ€™s here, because Julie took control and flew it somewhere else,â€� Miller said. â€œWhich means theyâ€™re looking for it, right?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden ignored that and put his hand back on Naomiâ€™s shoulder with what he hoped was companionable casualness.</p>
      <p>â€œWe have tight beam messages and the vector info,â€� he said. â€œAre they all going to the same place?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSort of,â€� she said, nodding with her right hand. â€œNot the same place, but all to what appear to be points in the Belt. But based on the changes in direction and the times they were sent, to one point in the Belt that is moving around, and not in a stable orbit either.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œA ship, then?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi gave another nod.</p>
      <p>â€œProbably,â€� she said. â€œIâ€™ve been playing with the locations, and I canâ€™t find anything in the registry that looks likely. No stations or inhabited rocks. A ship would make sense. Butâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>Holden waited for Naomi to finish, but Miller leaned forward impatiently.</p>
      <p>â€œBut what?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œBut how did they know where it would be?â€� she replied. â€œI have no incoming comms in the log. If a ship was moving around randomly in the Belt, howâ€™d they know where to send these messages?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden squeezed her shoulder, lightly enough that she probably didnâ€™t even feel it in the heavy environment suit, then pushed off and allowed himself to drift toward the ceiling.</p>
      <p>â€œSo itâ€™s not random,â€� he said. â€œThey had some sort of map of where this thing would be at the time they sent the laser comms. Could be one of their stealth ships.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi turned around in her chair to look up at him.</p>
      <p>â€œCould be a station,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s the lab,â€� Miller broke in. â€œTheyâ€™re running an experiment on Eros, they need the white coats nearby.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi,â€� Holden said. â€œ â€˜Materials secured.â€™ Thereâ€™s a safe in the captainâ€™s quarters thatâ€™s still locked down. Think you can get it open?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi gave a one-handed shrug.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know,â€� she said. â€œMaybe. Amos could probably blast it open with some of the explosives we found in that big box of weapons.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden h="1e anHolden laughed.</p>
      <p>â€œWell,â€� he said. â€œSince itâ€™s probably full of little vials of nasty alien viruses, Iâ€™m going to nix the blasting option.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi shut down the comm log and pulled up a general shipâ€™s systems menu.</p>
      <p>â€œI can look around and see if the computer has access to the safe,â€� she said. â€œTry to open it that way. It might take some time.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDo what you can,â€� Holden said. â€œWeâ€™ll get out of your hair.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden pushed himself off the ceiling and over to the ops compartment hatch, then pulled himself through, into the corridor beyond. A few moments later, Miller followed. The detective planted his feet on the deck with magnetic boots, then stared at Holden, waiting.</p>
      <p>Holden floated down to the deck next to him.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat do you think?â€� Holden asked. â€œProtogen being the whole thing? Or is this another one where it looks like them, so it isnâ€™t?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller was silent for the space of two long breaths.</p>
      <p>â€œThis one smells like the real thing,â€� Miller said. He sounded almost grudging.</p>
      <p>Amos pulled himself up the crew ladder from below, dragging a large metal case behind him.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, Capâ€™n,â€� he said. â€œI found a whole case of fuel pellets for the reactor in the machine shop. Weâ€™ll probably want to take these with us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood work,â€� Holden said, holding up one hand to let Miller know to wait. â€œGo ahead and take those across. Also, I need you to work up a plan for scuttling this ship.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWait, what?â€� Amos said. â€œThis thing is worth a jillion bucks, Captain. Stealth missile ship? The OPA would sell their grandmothers for this thing. And six of those tubes still have fish in them. Capital-ship busters. You could slag a small moon with those. Forget their grannies, the OPA would pimp their daughters for that gear. Why the fuck would we blow it up?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden stared at him in disbelief.</p>
      <p>â€œDid you forget whatâ€™s in the engine room?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œHell, Cap,â€� Amos snorted. â€œThat shit is all frozen. Couple hours with a torch and I can chop it up and chuck it out the airlock. Good to go.â€�</p>
      <p>The mental image of Amos hacking the melted bodies of the shipâ€™s former crew apart with a plasma torch and then cheerfully hurling the chunks out an airlock tipped Holden over the edge into full-fledged nausea. The big mechanicâ€™s ability just to ignore anything that he didnâ€™t want to notice probably came in handy while he was crawling around in tight and greasy engine compartments. His ability to shrug off the horrible mutilation of several dozen people threatened to change Holdenâ€™s disgust into anger.</p>
      <p>â€œForgetting the mess,â€� he said, â€œand the very real possibility of infection by what made that mess, there is also the fact that someone is desperately searching for this very expensive and very stealthy ship, and so far Alex canâ€™t find the ship thatâ€™s looking.â€�</p>
      <p>He stopped talking and nodded at Amos while the mechanic mulled that over. He could see Amosâ€™ broad face working as he put it together in his head. Found a stealth ship. Other people looking for stealth ship. We canâ€™t see the other people looking for it.</p>
      <p>Shit.</p>
      <p>Amosâ€™ face went pale.</p>
      <p>â€œRight,â€� he said. â€œIâ€™ll set the reactor up to slag her.â€� He looked down at the time on his suitâ€™s forearm display. â€œShit, weâ€™ve been here too long. Better get the lead out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBetter had,â€� Miller agreed.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Naomi was good. Very good. Holden had discovered this when heâ€™d signed on with the Canterbury, and over the course of years, heâ€™d added it to his list of facts, along with space is cold and the direction of gravity is down. When something stopped working on the water hauler, heâ€™d tell Naomi to fix it, and then never think of it again. Sometimes sheâ€™d claim not to be able to fix something, but it was always a negotiating tactic. A short conversation would lead to a request for spare parts or an additional crewman hired on at the next port, and that would be that. There was no problem that involved electronics or spaceship parts she couldnâ€™t solve.</p>
      <p>â€œI canâ€™t open the safe,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>She floated next to the safe in the captainâ€™s quarters, one foot resting lightly on his bunk to stabilize herself as she gestured. Holden stood on the floor with his boot mags on. Miller was in the hatchway to the corridor.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat would you need?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œIf you wonâ€™t let me blast it or cut it, I canâ€™t open it.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden shook his head, but Naomi either didnâ€™t see it or ignored him.</p>
      <p>â€œThe safe is designed to open when a very specific pattern of magnetic fields is played across that metal plate on the front,â€� she said. â€œSomeone has a key designed to do that, but that key isnâ€™t on this ship.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s at that station,â€� Miller said. â€œHe wouldnâ€™t send it there if they couldnâ€™t open it.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden stared at the wall safe for a moment, his fingers tapping on the bulkhead beside it.</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™re the chances cutting it sets off a booby trap?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œFucking excellent, Cap,â€� Amos said. He was listening in from the torpedo bay as he hacked the small fusion reactor that powered one of the six remaining torpedoes to go critical. Working on the shipâ€™s main reactor was too dangerous with the shielding stripped off.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi, I really want that safe and the research notes and samples it contains,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t know thatâ€™s whatâ€™s in there,â€� Miller said, then laughed. â€œNo, of course thatâ€™s whatâ€™s in there. But it wonâ€™t help us if we get blown up or, worse, if some piece of goo-coated shrapnel makes a hole in our nice suits.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m taking it,â€� Holden replied, then pulled a piece of chalk from his suitâ€™s pocket and drew a line around the safe on the bulkhead. â€œNaomi, cut a small hole in the bulkhead and see if thereâ€™s anything that would stop us from just cutting the whole damned thing out and taking it with us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™d have to take out half the wall.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi frowned, then shrugged, then smiled and nodded with one hand.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right, then,â€� ustifat,en,â€� she said. â€œThinking of taking it to Fredâ€™s people?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller laughed again, a dry humorless rasp that made Holden uneasy. The detective had been watching the video of Julie Maoâ€™s fight with her captors over and over again while theyâ€™d waited on Naomi and Amos to finish their work. It gave Holden the disquieting feeling that Miller was storing the footage in his head. Fuel for something he planned to do later.</p>
      <p>â€œMars would give you your lives back in exchange for this,â€� Miller said. â€œI hear Mars is nice if youâ€™re rich.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFuck rich,â€� Amos said with a grunt as he worked on something below. â€œTheyâ€™d build statues of us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe have an agreement with Fred to let him outbid any other contracts we take,â€� Holden said. â€œOf course, this isnâ€™t really a contract per seâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi smiled and winked at Holden.</p>
      <p>â€œSo what is it, sir?â€� she said, her voice faintly mocking. â€œOPA heroes? Martian billionaires? Start your own biotech firm? What are we doing here?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden pushed away from the safe and kicked out toward the airlock and the cutting torch that waited there with their other tools.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know yet,â€� he said. â€œBut it sure feels nice to have choices again.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Amos pushed the button again. No new stars flared in the dark. The radiation and infrared sensors remained quiet.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s supposed to be an explosion, right?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œFuck, yes,â€� Amos said, then pushed the button on the black box in his hand a third time. â€œThis isnâ€™t an exact science or anything. Those missile drives are as simple as it gets. Just a reactor with one wall missing. Canâ€™t exactly predictâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt isnâ€™t rocket science,â€� Holden said with a laugh.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Amos asked, ready to be angry if he was being mocked.</p>
      <p>â€œYou know, â€˜it isnâ€™t rocket science,â€™ â€� Holden said. â€œLike â€˜it isnâ€™t hard.â€™ Youâ€™re a rocket scientist, Amos. For real. You work on fusion reactors and starship drives for a living. Couple hundred years ago, people would have been lining up to give you their children for what you know.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat the fuâ€”â€� Amos started, but stopped when a new sun flared outside the cockpit window, then faded quickly. â€œSee? Fucking told you it would work.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNever doubted it,â€� Holden said, then slapped Amos on one meaty shoulder and headed aft down the crew ladder.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat the fuck was that about?â€� Amos asked no one in particular as Holden drifted away.</p>
      <p>He headed through the ops deck. Naomiâ€™s chair was empty. Heâ€™d ordered her to get some sleep. Strapped down to loops inset in the deck was the stealth shipâ€™s safe. It looked bigger cut out of the wall. Black and imposingly solid. The kind of container in which one kept the end of the solar system.</p>
      <p>Holden floated over to it and quietly said, â€œOpen sesame.â€�</p>
      <p>The safe ignored him, but the deck hatch opened and Miller pulled himself up into the compartment. His environment suit had been traded in for a stale-smelling blue jumpsfor a sce jumpsuit and his ever-present hat. There was something about the look on his face that made Holden uncomfortable. Even more so than the detective usually made him.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Miller just nodded and pulled himself over to one of the workstations, then buckled in to one of the chairs.</p>
      <p>â€œWe decided on a destination yet?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNo. Iâ€™m having Alex run the numbers on a couple of possibilities, but I havenâ€™t made up my mind.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBeen watching the news at all?â€� the detective asked.</p>
      <p>Holden shook his head, then moved over to a chair on the other side of the compartment. Something in Millerâ€™s face was chilling his blood.</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� he said. â€œWhat happened?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t hedge, Holden. I admire that about you, I guess.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJust tell me,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œNo, I mean it. A lot of people claim to believe in things. â€˜Family is most important,â€™ but theyâ€™ll screw a fifty-dollar hooker on payday. â€˜Country first,â€™ but they cheat on their taxes. Not you, though. You say everyone should know everything, and by God, you put your money where your mouth is.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller waited for him to say something, but Holden didnâ€™t know what. This speech had the feel of something the detective had prepared ahead of time. Might as well let him finish it.</p>
