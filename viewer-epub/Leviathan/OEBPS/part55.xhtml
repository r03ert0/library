      <h2>Fred chuckled.</h2>
      <p>â€œNice thought,â€� he said. â€œBut how do propose we defend something the size of Eros Station if Earth and Mars bring their navies to bear?â€�</p>
      <p>It was a good point. Miller felt a tug of sorrow. Even though Julie Maoâ€”his Julieâ€”was dead and gone, it felt like disloyalty to say it.</p>
      <p>â€œThen you have to get rid of it,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd how would I do that?â€� Fred said. â€œEven if we studded the thing with nukes, how would we be sure that no little scrap of the thing would make its way to a colony or down a well? Blowing that thing up would be like blowing dandelion fluff into the breeze.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller had neverlign="owi neverl seen a dandelion, but he saw the problem. Even the smallest portion of the goo filling Eros might be enough to start the whole evil experiment over again. And the goo thrived on radiation; simply cooking the station might hurry the thing along its occult path rather than end it. To be sure that the protomolecule on Eros never spread, theyâ€™d need to break everything on the station down to its constituent atomsâ€¦</p>
      <p>â€œOh,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œOh?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah. Youâ€™re not going to like this.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTry me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay. You asked. You drive Eros into the sun.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œInto the sun,â€� Fred said. â€œDo you have any idea how much mass weâ€™re talking about here?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded to the wide, clear expanse of window, to the construction yards beyond it. To the Nauvoo.</p>
      <p>â€œBig engines on that thing,â€� Miller said. â€œGet some fast ships out to the station, make sure no one can get in before you get there. Run the Nauvoo into Eros Station. Knock it sunward.â€�</p>
      <p>Fredâ€™s gaze turned inward as he planned, calculated.</p>
      <p>â€œGot to make sure no one gets into it until it hits corona. Thatâ€™ll be hard, but Earth and Mars are both just as interested in keeping the other guy from having it as in getting it themselves.â€�</p>
      <p>Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t do better, Julie, he thought. But itâ€™ll be a hell of a funeral.</p>
      <p>Fredâ€™s breath grew slow and deep, his gaze flickering as if he were reading something in the air that only he could see. Miller didnâ€™t interrupt, even when the silence got heavy. It was almost a minute later that Fred let out a short, percussive breath.</p>
      <p>â€œThe Mormons are going to be pissed,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Chapter Forty-Five: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Naomi talked in her sleep. It was one of a dozen things Holden hadnâ€™t known about her before tonight. Even though theyâ€™d slept in crash couches a few feet apart on many occasions, heâ€™d never heard it. Now, with her face against his bare chest, he could feel her lips move and the soft, punctuated exhalations of her words. He couldnâ€™t hear what she was saying.</p>
      <p>She also had a scar on her back, just above her left buttock. It was three inches long and had the uneven edges and rippling that came from a tear rather than a slice. Naomi would never get herself knifed in a bar fight, so it had to have come on the job. Maybe she had been climbing through tight spaces in the engine room when the ship maneuvered unexpectedly. A competent plastic surgeon could have made it invisible in one visit. That she hadnâ€™t bothered and clearly didnâ€™t care was another thing he had learned about her tonight.</p>
      <p>She stopped murmuring and smacked her lips a few times, then said, â€œThirsty.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden slid out from under her and headed for the kitchen, knowing that this was the obsequiousness that always accompanied a new lover. For the next couple of weeks, he wouldnâ€™t be able to stop himself from fulfilling every whim Naomi might have. It was a behavior some men carried at the genetic level, their DNA wanting to make sure that first time wasnâ€™t just a fluke.</p>
      <p>Her room waem" alomi…s laid out differently than his, and the unfamiliarity made him clumsy in the dark. He fumbled around for a few minutes in her small kitchen nook, looking for a glass. By the time he found it, filled it, and headed back into the bedroom, Naomi was sitting up in bed. The sheet lay pooled on her lap. The sight of her half nude in the dimly lit room gave him an embarrassingly sudden erection.</p>
      <p>Naomi panned her gaze up his body, pausing at his midsection, then at the water glass, and said, â€œIs that for me?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden didnâ€™t know which thing she was asking about, so he just said, â€œYes.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œYou asleep?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomiâ€™s face was on his belly, her breathing slow and deep, but to his surprise she said, â€œNo.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCan we talk?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi rolled off him and pulled herself up until her face lay next to his on the pillow. Her hair fell across her eyes, and Holden reached out and brushed it away in a move that felt so intimate and proprietary that he had to swallow a lump in his throat.</p>
      <p>â€œAre you about to get serious on me?â€� she asked, her eyes half lidded.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, I am,â€� he said, and kissed her forehead.</p>
      <p>â€œMy last lover was over a year ago,â€� she said. â€œIâ€™m a serial monogamist, so as far as Iâ€™m concerned, this is an exclusive-rights deal until one of us decides it isnâ€™t. As long as I get advance warning that youâ€™ve decided to end the deal, there wonâ€™t be any hard feelings. Iâ€™m open to the idea of it being more than just sex, but in my experience that will happen on its own if itâ€™s going to. I have eggs in storage on Europa and Luna, if that matters to you.â€�</p>
      <p>She rolled up onto her elbow, her face hovering over his.</p>
      <p>â€œDid I cover all the bases?â€� she asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� he said. â€œBut I agree to the conditions.â€�</p>
      <p>She flopped onto her back, letting out a long contented sigh.</p>
      <p>â€œGood.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden wanted to hold her, but he felt too hot and sticky with sweat, so he just reached down and held her hand instead. He wanted to tell her that this meant something, that it was already more than sex for him, but all the words he tried out in his head came off sounding phony or maudlin.</p>
      <p>â€œThank you,â€� he said instead, but she was already snoring quietly.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>They had sex again in the morning. After a long night with too little sleep, it wound up being far more effort than release for Holden, but there was a pleasure in that too, as if less than mind-blowing sex somehow meant something different and funnier and gentler than what theyâ€™d already done together. Afterward, Holden went to the kitchen and made coffee, then brought it back to bed on a tray. They drank it without talking, some of the shyness theyâ€™d avoided the night before coming now in the artificial morning of the roomâ€™s LEDs.</p>
      <p>Naomi put her empty coffee cup down and touched the badly healed lump in his recently broken nose.</p>
      <p>â€œIs it hideous?â€� Holden askâ€œIs anken askâed.</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� she said. â€œYou were too perfect before. It makes you seem more substantial.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden laughed. â€œThat sounds like a word you use to describe a fat man or a history professor.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi smiled and touched his chest lightly with her fingertips. It wasnâ€™t an attempt to arouse, just the exploration that came when satiation had removed sex from the equation. Holden tried to remember the last time the cold sanity following sex had been this comfortable, but maybe that had been never. He was making plans to spend the remainder of the day in Naomiâ€™s bed, running through a mental list of restaurants on the station that delivered, when his terminal began buzzing on the nightstand.</p>
      <p>â€œGod dammit,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t have to answer,â€� Naomi replied, and moved her explorations to his belly.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve been paying attention the last couple months, right?â€� Holden said. â€œUnless itâ€™s a wrong number, then itâ€™s probably some end-of-the-solar-system-type shit and we have five minutes to evacuate the station.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi kissed his ribs, which simultaneously tickled him and caused him to question his assumptions about his own refractory period.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s not funny,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>Holden sighed and picked up the terminal off the table. Fredâ€™s name flashed as it buzzed again.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s Fred,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Naomi stopped kissing him and sat up.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, then itâ€™s probably not good news.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden tapped on the screen to accept the call and said, â€œFred.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJim. Come see me as soon as you get a chance. Itâ€™s important.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden replied. â€œBe there in half an hour.â€�</p>
      <p>He ended the call and tossed his hand terminal across the room onto the pile of clothes heâ€™d left at the foot of the bed.</p>
      <p>â€œGoing to shower, then go see what Fred wants,â€� he said, pulling off the sheet and getting up.</p>
      <p>â€œShould I come, too?â€� Naomi asked.</p>
      <p>â€œAre you kidding? Iâ€™m never letting you out of my sight again.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t get creepy on me,â€� Naomi replied, but she was smiling when she said it.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The first unpleasant surprise was Miller sitting in Fredâ€™s office when they arrived. Holden nodded at the man once, then said to Fred, â€œWeâ€™re here. Whatâ€™s up?â€�</p>
      <p>Fred gestured for them to sit, and when they had, he said, â€œWeâ€™ve been discussing what to do about Eros.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden shrugged. â€œOkay. What about it?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMiller thinks that someone will try to land there and recover some samples of the protomolecule.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI have no trouble believing that someone will be that stupid,â€� Holden said with a nod.</p>
      <p>Fred stood up and tapped something on his desk. The screens that normally showed a view of the Nauvoo construction outside suddenly switcheuctionleswitcheud to a 2-D map of the solar system, tiny lights of different colors marking fleet positions. An angry swarm of green dots surrounded Mars. Holden assumed that meant the greens were Earth ships. There were a lot of red and yellow dots in the Belt and outer planets. Red was probably Mars, then.</p>
      <p>â€œNice map,â€� Holden said. â€œAccurate?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œReasonably,â€� Fred said. With a few quick taps on his desk, he zoomed in on one portion of the Belt. A potato-shaped lump labeled EROS filled the middle of the screen. Two tiny green dots inched toward it from several meters away.</p>
      <p>â€œThat is the Earth science vessel Charles Lyell moving toward Eros at full burn. Sheâ€™s accompanied by what we think is a Phantom-class escort ship.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Rociâ€™s Earth navy cousin,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, the Phantom class is an older model, and largely relegated to rear-echelon assignments, but still more than a match for anything the OPA can quickly field,â€� Fred replied.</p>
      <p>â€œExactly the sort of ship that would be escorting science ships around, though,â€� Holden said. â€œHowâ€™d they get out there so quick? And why just the two of them?â€�</p>
      <p>Fred backed the map up until it was a distant view of the entire solar system again.</p>
      <p>â€œDumb luck. The Lyell was returning to Earth from doing non-Belt asteroid mapping when it diverted course toward Eros. It was close; no one else was. Earth must have seen a chance to grab a sample while everyone else was figuring out what to do.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden looked over at Naomi, but her face was unreadable. Miller was staring at him like an entomologist trying to figure out exactly where the pin went.</p>
      <p>â€œSo they know, then?â€� Holden said. â€œAbout Protogen and Eros?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe assume so,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou want us to chase them away? I mean, I think we can, but that will only work until Earth can reroute a few more ships to back them up. We wonâ€™t be able to buy much time.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred smiled.</p>
      <p>â€œWe wonâ€™t need much,â€� he said. â€œWe have a plan.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden nodded, waiting to hear it, but Fred sat down and leaned back in his chair. Miller stood up and changed the view on the screen to a close-up of the surface of Eros.</p>
      <p>Now we get to find out why Fred is keeping this jackal around, Holden thought, but said nothing.</p>
      <p>Miller pointed at the picture of Eros.</p>
      <p>â€œEros is an old station. Lots of redundancy. Lot of holes in her skin, mostly small maintenance airlocks,â€� the former detective said. â€œThe big docks are in five main clusters around the station. Weâ€™re looking at sending six supply freighters to Eros, along with the Rocinante. The Roci keeps the science vessel from landing, and the freighters secure themselves to the station, one at each docking cluster.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re sending people in?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œNot in,â€� Miller replied. â€œJust on. Surface work. Anyway, the sixth freighter evacuates the crews once the others are docked. Each abandoned freighter will have a couple dozen high-yield fusion warheads wired to the shipâ€™s proximity detectors. Anything tries to land at the docks, and thereâ€™s a few-hundred-megaton fusion explosion.ndred-m" osion.n It should be enough to take out the approaching ship, but even if it doesnâ€™t, the docks will be too slagged to land at.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi cleared her throat. â€œUh, the UN and Mars both have bomb squads. Theyâ€™ll figure out how to get past your booby traps.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGiven enough time,â€� Fred agreed.</p>
      <p>Miller continued as though he hadnâ€™t been interrupted.</p>
      <p>â€œThe bombs are just a second line of deterrence. Rocinante first, bombs second. Weâ€™re trying to buy Fredâ€™s people enough time to prep the Nauvoo.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Nauvoo?â€� Holden said, and half a breath later, Naomi whistled low. Miller nodded to her almost as if he were accepting applause.</p>
      <p>â€œThe Nauvooâ€™s launching in a long parabolic course, building up speed. Itâ€™ll hit Eros at a velocity and angle calculated to knock Eros toward the sun. Set off the bombs too. Between the impact energy and the fusion warheads, we figure the surface of Erosâ€™ll be hot and radioactive enough to cook anything that tries to land until itâ€™s too damn late,â€� Miller finished, then sat back down. He looked up as if he was waiting for reactions.</p>
      <p>â€œThis was your idea?â€� Holden asked Miller.</p>
      <p>â€œNauvoo part was. But we didnâ€™t know about the Lyell when we first talked about it. The booby trap thingâ€™s kind of improvised. I think itâ€™ll work, though. Buy us enough time.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI agree,â€� Holden said. â€œWe need to keep Eros out of anyoneâ€™s hands, and I canâ€™t think of a better way to do it. Weâ€™re in. Weâ€™ll shoo the science ship away while you do your work.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred leaned forward in his chair with a creak and said, â€œI knew youâ€™d be on board. Miller was more skeptical.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThrowing a million people into the sun seemed like something you might balk at,â€� the detective said with a humorless grin.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s nothing human left on that station. Whatâ€™s your part in all of this? You armchair quarterbacking now?â€�</p>
      <p>It came out nastier than heâ€™d intended, but Miller didnâ€™t appear offended.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll be coordinating security.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSecurity? Why will they need security?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller smiled. All his smiles looked like he was hearing a good joke at a funeral.</p>
      <p>â€œIn case something crawls out of an airlock, tries to thumb a ride,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Holden frowned. â€œI donâ€™t like to think those things can get around in vacuum. I donâ€™t like that idea at all.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOnce we bring the surface temp of Eros up to a nice balmy ten thousand degrees, Iâ€™m thinking it wonâ€™t matter much,â€� Miller replied. â€œUntil then, best be safe.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden found himself wishing he shared the detectiveâ€™s confidence.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat are the odds the impact and detonations just break Eros into a million pieces and scatter them all over the solar system?â€� Naomi asked.</p>
      <p>â€œFredâ€™s got some of his best engineers calculating everything to the last decimal to make sure that doesnâ€™t happen,â€� Miller replied. â€œTycho helped build Eros in the first place. Theyâ€™ve got the blueprints.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo,â€� said Fred. â€œLetâ€™>â€œSo€� Letâ€™>s deal with the last bit of business.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden waited.</p>
      <p>â€œYou still have the protomolecule,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>Holden nodded again. â€œAnd?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd,â€� replied Fred. â€œAnd the last time we sent you out, your ship was almost wrecked. Once Eros has been nuked, it will be the only confirmed sample around, outside of what might still be on Phoebe. I canâ€™t find any reason to let you keep it. I want it to remain here on Tycho when you go.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden stood up, shaking his head.</p>
      <p>â€œI like you, Fred, but Iâ€™m not handing that stuff over to anyone who might see it as a bargaining chip.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t think you have a lot ofâ€”â€� Fred started, but Holden held up a finger and cut him off. While Fred stared at him in surprise, he grabbed his terminal and opened the crew channel.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex, Amos, either of you on the ship?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m here,â€� Amos said a second later. â€œFinishing up someâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLock it down,â€� Holden said over him. â€œRight now. Seal it up. If I donâ€™t call you in an hour, or if anyone other than me tries to board, leave the dock and fly away from Tycho at best possible speed. Direction is your choice. Shoot your way free if you have to. Read me?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLoud and clear, Cap,â€� Amos said. If Holden had asked him to get a cup of coffee, Amos would have sounded exactly the same.</p>
      <p>Fred was still staring at him incredulously.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t force this issue, Fred,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œIf you think you can threaten me, youâ€™re mistaken,â€� Fred said, his voice flat and frightening.</p>
      <p>Miller laughed.</p>
      <p>â€œSomething funny?â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œThat wasnâ€™t a threat,â€� Miller replied.</p>
      <p>â€œNo? What would you call it?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAn accurate report of the world,â€� Miller said. He stretched slowly as he talked. â€œIf it was Alex on board, he might think the captain was trying to intimidate someone, maybe back down at the last minute. Amos, though? Amos will absolutely shoot his way free, even if it means he goes down with the ship.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred scowled, and Miller shook his head.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not a bluff,â€� Miller said. â€œDonâ€™t call it.â€�</p>
      <p>Fredâ€™s eyes narrowed, and Holden wondered if heâ€™d finally gone too far with the man. He certainly wouldnâ€™t be the first person Fred Johnson had ordered shot. And he had Miller standing right next to him. The unbalanced detective would probably shoot him at the first hint someone thought it was a good idea. It shook Holdenâ€™s confidence in Fred that Miller was even here.</p>
      <p>Which made it a little more surprising when Miller saved him.</p>
