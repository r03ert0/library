			<p class="Book-Entry-Title">INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGES</p>
			<p class="Book-Entry-Text-FL">At the time of European arrival, the indigenous peoples of Australia are estimated to have spoken between 250 and 400 languages, making it one of the most linguistically diverse places in the world.</p>
			<p class="Book-Entry-Text">Almost all indigenous languages share several distinctive phonological features (e.g., lack of fricatives), which suggests the existence of a relatively small set of ancestors, or perhaps even a single common language. Why this would have been abandoned, given its utility to intertribal communication, is unclear.</p>
