      <h2>His suit alarms shrieked at him when he undid his helmet...</h2>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re driving this bus, Julie,â€� he said. â€œDo you know that? I mean, can you tell?â€�</p>
      <p>Her fingers were cool in his, but not cold.</p>
      <p>â€œI can feelâ€¦ something,â€� she said. â€œIâ€™m hungry? Not hungry, butâ€¦ I want something. I want to go back to Earth.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe canâ€™t do that. I need you to change course,â€� Miller replied. What had Holden said? Give her Venus. â€œHead for Venus instead.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s not what it wants,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s what weâ€™ve got on offer,â€� Miller said. Then, a moment later: â€œWe canâ€™t go home. We need to go to Venus.â€�</p>
      <p>She was quiet for a long moment.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re a fighter, Julie. Youâ€™ve never let anyone call your shots for you. Donâ€™t start now. If we go to Earthâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™ll eat them too. The same way it ate me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah.â€�</p>
      <p>She looked up at him.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� he said again. â€œLike that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat happens on Venus?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe die maybe. I donâ€™t know. But we donâ€™t take a lot of people with us, and we make sure no one gets a hold of this crap,â€� he said, gesturing at the grotto around them. â€œAnd if we donâ€™t die, thenâ€¦ well, thatâ€™ll be interesting.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t think I can.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou can. The thing thatâ€™s doing all this? Youâ€™re smarter than it is. Youâ€™re in control. Take us to Venus.â€�</p>
      <p>The fireflies swirled around them, the blue light pulsing slightly: bright and dim, bright and dim. Miller saw it in her face when she made the decision. All around them, the lights went bright, the grotto flooding in soft blue, and then dimmed back to where they had been before. Miller felt something catch at the back of his neck like the first warning of a sore throat. He wondered if heâ€™d have time to deactivate the bomb. And then he looked at Julie. Juliette Andromeda Mao. OPA pilot. Heir to the Mao-Kwikowski corporate throne. The seed crystal of a future beyond anything heâ€™d ever dreamed. Heâ€™d have plenty of time.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m afraid,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t be,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œNo one ever does. And, look, you donâ€™t have to do this alone,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œI can feel something in the back of my mind. It wants something I donâ€™t understand. Itâ€™s so big.â€�</p>
      <p>Reflexively, he kissed the back of her hand. There was an ache starting deep in his belly. A sense of illness. A momentâ€™s nausea. The first pangs of his transformation into Eros.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€� he said. â€œWeâ€™re gonna be fine.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Fifty-Five: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Holden dreamed.</p>
      <p>Heâ€™d been a lucid dreamer most of his life, so when he found himself sitting in his parentsâ€™ kitchen in the old house in Montana, talking to Naomi, he knew. He couldnâ€™t quite understand what she was saying, but she kept pushing her hair out of her eyes as she munched cookies and drank tea. And while he found that he wasnâ€™t ever able to pick a cookie up and take a bite out of it, he could smell them, and the memory of Mother Eliseâ€™s chocolate chip oatmeal cookies was a very good one.</p>
      <p>It was a good dream.</p>
      <p>The kitchen strobed red once, and something changed. Holden felt the wrongness of it, felt the dream slipping from warm memory into nightmare. He tried to say something to Naomi but couldnâ€™t form the words. The room strobed red again, but she didnâ€™t seem to notice. He got up and went to the kitchen window and looked out. When the room strobed a third time, he saw what was causing it. Meteors were falling out of the sky, leaving behind them fiery trails the color of blood. He somehow knew they were chunks of Eros as it crashed through the atmosphere. Miller had failed. The nuclear attack had failed.</p>
      <p>Julie had come home.</p>
      <p>He turned around to tell Naomi to run, but black tendrils had burst through the floor and wrapped her up, pierced her body in multiple places. They poured from her mouth and eyes.</p>
      <p>Holden tried to run to her, to help her, but he couldnâ€™t move, and when he looked down, he saw that the tendrils had come up and grabbed him too. One wrapped around his waist and held him. Another pressed into his mouth.</p>
      <p>He woke with a yell in a dark room that was strobing with red light. Something was holding him around the waist. In a panic he began clawing at it, threatening to tear a fingernail loose on his left hand, before his rational mind reminded him where he was. On the ops deck, in his chair, belted down in zero g.</p>
      <p>He popped his finger into his mouth, trying to soothe the abused fingertip heâ€™d damaged on one of the chair buckles, and took a few deep breaths through his nose. The deck was empty. Naomi was asleep down in her cabin. Alex and Amos were off duty and presumably sleeping too. Theyâ€™d spent almost two days without rest during the high-g chase of Eros. Holden had ordered everyone to get some shut-eye and had volunteered to take first watch.</p>
      <p>And then had promptly fallen asleep. Not good.</p>
      <p>The room flashed red again. Holden shook his head to clear the last of the sleep away, and refocused his attention on his console. A red warning light pulsed, and he tapped the screen to open up the menu. It was his threat panthe me Vel. Someone was hitting them with a targeting laser.</p>
      <p>He opened up the threat display and turned on the active sensors. The only ship within millions of kilometers was the Ravi, and it was the ship that was targeting them. According to the automatic logs, it had just started a few seconds earlier.</p>
      <p>He reached out to activate the comm and call the Ravi as his incoming-message light flickered on. He opened the connection, and a second later, McBrideâ€™s voice said, â€œRocinante, cease maneuvering, open your outer airlock door, and prepare to be boarded.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden frowned at his console. Was that a weird joke?</p>
      <p>â€œMcBride, this is Holden. Uh, what?â€�</p>
      <p>Her reply was in a clipped tone that was not encouraging.</p>
      <p>â€œHolden, open your outer airlock and prepare for boarding. If I see a single defensive system wake up, I will fire on your ship. Is that understood?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� he said, not quite able to keep the annoyance out of his voice. â€œItâ€™s not understood. And Iâ€™m not going to let you board me. What the hell is going on?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve been ordered by UNN Command to take control of your vessel. Youâ€™re charged with interfering with UNN military operations, unlawfully commandeering UNN military assets, and a list of other crimes Iâ€™m not going to bother reading right now. If you do not surrender immediately, we will be forced to fire on you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOh,â€� said Holden. The UNN had discovered that their missiles were changing course, had attempted to reprogram them, and had discovered that the missiles werenâ€™t listening.</p>
      <p>They were upset.</p>
      <p>â€œMcBride,â€� Holden said after a moment. â€œBoarding us wonâ€™t do any good. We canâ€™t give you those missiles back. And itâ€™s unnecessary, anyway. Theyâ€™re just taking a little detour.â€�</p>
      <p>McBrideâ€™s laugh sounded more like the sharp bark of an angry dog just before it bit.</p>
      <p>â€œDetour?â€� she said. â€œYou handed three thousand five hundred and seventy-three high-yield thermonuclear interplanetary ballistic missiles over to a traitor and accused war criminal!â€�</p>
      <p>It took Holden a minute.</p>
      <p>â€œYou mean Fred? I think traitor is a bit harshâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>McBride cut in.</p>
      <p>â€œDeactivate the false transponders leading our missiles away from Eros, and reactivate the transponders on the surface, or we will fire on your ship. You have ten minutes to comply.â€�</p>
      <p>The connection dropped with a click. Holden looked at the console with something between disbelief and outrage, then shrugged and hit the battle stations alarm. Deck lights came on all over the ship in an angry red. The warning Klaxon sounded three times. In less than two minutes, Alex rushed up the ladder to the cockpit, and half a minute behind him, Naomi threw herself into her ops station.</p>
      <p>Alex spoke first.</p>
      <p>â€œThe Ravi is four hundred kilometers away,â€� he said. â€œLadar says her tube is open, and sheâ€™s got us locked.â€�</p>
      <p>Clearly enunciating his words, Holden said, â€œDo notâ€”I repeat, do notâ€”open our tubes or attempt to get a target lock on the Ravi at this time. Just keep a close eye on her, and prepare to go defensive if she looks lito go  [ookke sheâ€™s firing. Letâ€™s not do anything to provoke her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShall I begin jamming?â€� Naomi said from behind him.</p>
      <p>â€œNo, that would look aggressive. But prep a countermeasures package and have your finger on the ready button,â€� Holden said. â€œAmos, you in engineering?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that, Cap. Ready to go down here.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBring the reactor up to one hundred percent and pull control of the point defense cannons to your console down there. If they shoot at us at this range, Alex wonâ€™t have time to fly and shoot back. You see a red dot on the threat console, you open up with the PDCs immediately. Copy?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>Holden blew a long breath through his teeth, then opened the channel to the Ravi again.</p>
      <p>â€œMcBride, this is Holden. We are not surrendering, we are not going to let you board us, and we arenâ€™t going to comply with your demands. Where do we go from here?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHolden,â€� McBride said. â€œYour reactor is coming up. Are you getting ready to fight with us?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, just getting ready to try and survive. Why, are we fighting?â€�</p>
      <p>Another short harsh laugh.</p>
      <p>â€œHolden,â€� McBride said. â€œWhy do I get the feeling you arenâ€™t taking this seriously?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOh, I absolutely am,â€� Holden replied. â€œI donâ€™t want you to kill me, and believe it or not, I have no desire to kill you. The nukes are on a little detour, but this isnâ€™t something we need to go down in flames over. I canâ€™t give you what you want, and Iâ€™m not interested in spending the next thirty years in a military prison. You gain nothing by shooting us, and I will fight back if it comes to that.â€�</p>
      <p>McBride cut the channel.</p>
      <p>â€œCaptain,â€� Alex said. â€œThe Ravi is startinâ€™ to maneuver. Sheâ€™s spraying clutter. I think sheâ€™s gettinâ€™ ready to make an attack run.â€�</p>
      <p>Shit. Holden had been so sure he could talk her out of it.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, go defensive. Naomi, start your countermeasures. Amos? Got your finger on that button?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œReady,â€� Amos replied.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t hit it until you see a missile launch. Donâ€™t want to force their hand.â€�</p>
      <p>Sudden crushing gâ€™s hit Holden, stuffing him into his chair. Alex had started maneuvering.</p>
      <p>â€œAt this distance, maybe I can out-turn her. Keep her from beinâ€™ able to take a shot,â€� the pilot said.</p>
      <p>â€œDo it, and open the tubes.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger,â€� Alex said, his professional pilotâ€™s calm not quite able to keep the excitement about a possible battle out of his voice.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve broken the targeting lock,â€� Naomi said. â€œTheir laser array is not nearly as good as the Rociâ€™s. Iâ€™m just drowning it in clutter.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHooray for bloated Martian defense budgets,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>The ship jerked suddenly through a series of wild maneuvers.</p>
      <p>â€œDamn,â€� Alex said, his voice strained by the g-force of the sharp turns. â€œThe Ravi just opened up on us with her PDCs.â€�ened u [DCs</p>
      <p>Holden checked his threat display and saw the long glowing pearl strands of incoming rounds displayed there. The shots were falling well behind them. The Roci reported the distance between the ships as 370 kilometersâ€”pretty long range for computer targeting systems to hit a wildly maneuvering ship with a ballistic shot from another wildly maneuvering ship.</p>
      <p>â€œReturn fire?â€� Amos yelled into the comm.</p>
      <p>â€œNo!â€� Holden yelled back. â€œIf she wanted us dead, sheâ€™d be throwing torpedoes. Donâ€™t give her a reason to want us dead.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCap, weâ€™re out-turninâ€™ her,â€� Alex said. â€œThe Rociâ€™s just too fast. Weâ€™ll have a firing solution in less than a minute.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œDo I take the shot?â€� Alex asked, his silly Martian cowboy accent fading as his tension rose.</p>
      <p>â€œNo.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTheir targeting laser just shut off,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhich means theyâ€™ve given up trying to cut our jamming,â€� Holden replied, â€œand have just switched their missiles over to radar tracking.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot as accurate,â€� Naomi said hopefully.</p>
      <p>â€œA corvette like that carries at least a dozen fish. They only need to hit us with one to make us dead. And at this rangeâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>A gentle sound came from his threat console, letting him know that the Roci had calculated a firing solution to the Ravi.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve got tone!â€� Alex yelled. â€œFire?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo!â€� Holden said. He knew that inside the Ravi, they were getting the loud warning buzz of an enemy lock. Stop, Holden willed them. Please donâ€™t make me kill you.</p>
      <p>â€œUh,â€� Alex said in a low voice. â€œHuh.â€�</p>
      <p>Behind Holden, at almost the same moment, Naomi said, â€œJim?â€�</p>
      <p>Before he could ask, Alex came back on the general comm.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, Captain, Eros just came back.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Holden said, a brief image of the asteroid sneaking up like a cartoon villain on the two circling warships popping into his head.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Alex said. â€œEros. It just popped back up on radar. Whatever it was doing to block our sensors, it just stopped doing it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™s it doing?â€� Holden said. â€œGet me a course.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi pulled the tracking information to her console and began working on it, but Alex was done a few seconds sooner.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� he said. â€œGood guess. Itâ€™s changing course. Still heading sunward, but deflecting away from the Earth vector it was on.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf it keeps this course and speed,â€� Naomi chimed in, â€œIâ€™d say it was heading toward Venus.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWow,â€� said Holden. â€œThat was a joke.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood joke,â€� Naomi said.</p>
