			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-First"><span class="epi-source">ROME:</span> Overcrowding contributed to the deaths of 24 people in a popular Italian nightclub, early reports suggest.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The fire, believed to have been caused by faulty wiring, tore through the Paradiso Club at around 10 <span class="epi-source">P.M.</span> last Saturday night, when the building was at its most packed.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Reports in Italian media said a crush developed at exits to one of the club’s dance floors, with patrons unable to escape and becoming overcome by smoke. All two dozen people in this area are believed to have perished.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Mariastella Gallioni, 18, who escaped the adjoining Musica section, described seeing a doorway filled with people. “There were two men [trying to get out] but they didn’t move. They were blocking the doorway. No one could get past.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The Paradiso recently completed a major renovation, during which it was granted fire certification. Italy’s government inspectors are notoriously corrupt.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-Last">Police have promised a full investigation.</p>
