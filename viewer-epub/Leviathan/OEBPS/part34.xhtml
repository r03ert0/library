      <h2>â€œOkay. Seriously, I think Miller there lets his cop...</h2>
      <p>Amos interrupted with a grunt.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s some holes in that, Capâ€™n,â€� Amos said. â€œLike what the fuck does that have to do with taking down the Cant and the Donnager?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden looked Naomi in the eye and said, â€œWe have a place to look now, donâ€™t we?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, we do,â€� she said. â€œBA834024112. Thatâ€™s a rock designation.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat do you think is out there?â€� Alex asked.</p>
      <p>â€œIf I was a betting man, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s whatever ship she stole that shuttle from,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>â€œMakes sense,â€� Naomi said. â€œEvery rock in the Belt is mapped. You want to hide something, put it in a stable orbit next to one and you can always find it later.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller turned toward Holden, his face even more drawn.</p>
      <p>â€œIf youâ€™re going there, I want in,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhy?â€� Holden asked. â€œNo offense, but you found your girl. Your jobâ€™s over, right?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller looked at him, his lips a thin line.</p>
      <p>â€œDifferent case,â€� Miller said. â€œNow itâ€™s about who killed her.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Twenty-Six: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Your police friend put a lockdown order on my ship,â€� Holden said. He sounded outraged.</p>
      <p>Around them, the hotel restaurant was busy. Last shiftâ€™s prostitutes mixed with the next shiftâ€™s tourists and businessmen at the cheap pink-lit buffet. The pilot and the big guyâ€”Alex and Amosâ€”were vying for the last bagel. Naomi sat at Holdenâ€™s side, her arms crossed, a cup of bad coffee cooling before her.</p>
      <p>â€œWe did kill some people,â€� Miller said gently.</p>
      <p>â€œI thought you got us out of that with your secret police handshake,â€� Holden said. â€œSo whyâ€™s my ship in lockdown?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou remember when Sematimba said we shouldnâ€™t leave the station without telling him?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œI remember you making some kind of deal,â€� Holden said. â€œI donâ€™t remember agreeing to it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLook, heâ€™s going to keep us here until heâ€™s sure he wonâ€™t get fired for letting us go. Once he knows his ass is covered, the lock goes down. So letâ€™s talk about the part where I rent a berth on your ship.â€�</p>
      <p>Jim Holden and his XO exchanged a glance, one of those tiny human burst communications that said more than words could have. Miller didnâ€™t know either of them well enough to decode all of it, but he guessed they were skeptical.</p>
      <p>They had reason to be. Miller had checked his credit balance before heâ€™d called them. He had enough left for another night in the hotel or a good dinner, but not both. He was spending it on a cheap breakfast that Holden and his crew didnâ€™t need and probably wouldnâ€™t enjoy, buying good will.</p>
      <p>â€œI need to make very, very sure I understand what youâ€™re saying,â€� Holden said as the big oneâ€”Amosâ€”returned and sat at his other side holding the bagel. â€œAre you saying that unless I let you on my ship, your friend is going to keep us here? Because thatâ€™s blackmail.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œExtortion,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not blackmail,â€� Naomi said. â€œThat would be if he threatened to expose information we didnâ€™t want known. If itâ€™s just a threat, thatâ€™s extortion.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd itâ€™s not what Iâ€™m talking about,â€� Miller said. â€œFreedom of the station while the investigation rolls? Thatâ€™s no trouble. Leaving jurisdictionâ€™s another thing. I canâ€™t hold you here any more than I can cut you loose. Iâ€™m just looking for a ride when you go.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œBecause youâ€™re going to Julieâ€™s asteroid,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m willing to bet thereâ€™s no port there,â€� Holden said. â€œDid you plan on going anyplace after that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m kind of low on solid plans. Havenâ€™t had one yet that actually happened.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI hear that,â€� Amos said. â€œWeâ€™ve been fucked eighteen different ways since we got into this.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden folded his hands on the table, one finger tapping a complicated rhythm on the wood-textured concrete top. It wasnâ€™t a good sign.</p>
      <p>â€œYou seem like aâ€¦ well, like an angry, bitter old man, actually. But Iâ€™ve been working water haulers for the past five years. That just means youâ€™d fit in.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBut,â€� Miller said, and let the word hang there.</p>
      <p>â€œBut Iâ€™ve been shot at a lot recently, and the machine guns yesterday were the least lethal thing Iâ€™ve had to deal with,â€� Holden said. â€œIâ€™m not letting anyone on my ship that I wouldnâ€™t trust with my life, and I donâ€™t actually know you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI can get the money,â€� Miller said, his belly sinking. â€œIf itâ€™s money, I can cover it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not about negotiatin>â€œ kegog a price,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œGet the money?â€� Naomi said, her eyes narrowing. â€œ â€˜Get the money,â€™ as in you donâ€™t have it now?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m a little short,â€� Miller said. â€œItâ€™s temporary.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou have an income?â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œMore like a strategy,â€� Miller said. â€œThereâ€™s some independent rackets down on the docks. There always are at any port. Side games. Fights. Things like that. Most of them, the fix is in. Itâ€™s how you bribe cops without actually bribing cops.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s your plan?â€� Holden said, incredulity in his voice. â€œGo collect some police bribes?â€�</p>
      <p>Across the restaurant, a prostitute in a red nightgown yawned prodigiously; the john across the table from her frowned.</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Miller said reluctantly. â€œI play the side bets. A cop goes in, I make a side bet that heâ€™s going to win. I know who the cops are mostly. The house, they know because theyâ€™re bribing them. The side bets are with fish looking to feel edgy because theyâ€™re playing unlicensed.â€�</p>
      <p>Even as he said it, Miller knew how weak it sounded. Alex, the pilot, came and sat beside Miller. His coffee smelled bright and acidic.</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™s the deal?â€� Alex asked.</p>
      <p>â€œThere isnâ€™t one,â€� Holden said. â€œThere wasnâ€™t one before and there still isnâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt works better than youâ€™d think,â€� Miller said gamely, and four hand terminals chimed at once. Holden and Naomi exchanged another, less complicit glance and pulled up their terminals. Amos and Alex already had theirs up. Miller caught the red-and-green border that meant either a priority message or an early Christmas card. There was a momentâ€™s silence as they all read something; then Amos whistled low.</p>
      <p>â€œStage three?â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œCanâ€™t say as I like the sound of that,â€� Alex said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou mind if I ask?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Holden slid his terminal across the table. The message was plaintext, encoded from Tycho.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>CAUGHT MOLE IN TYCHO COMM STATION. YOUR PRESENCE AND DESTINATION LEAKED TO UNKNOWN PERSONS ON EROS. BE CAREFUL.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œLittle late on that,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œKeep reading,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>MOLEâ€™S ENCRYPTION CODE ALLOWED INTERCEPT OF SUBSIGNAL BROADCAST FROM EROS FIVE HOURS AGO.INTERCEPTED MESSAGE FOLLOWS: HOLDEN ESCAPED BUT PAYLOAD SAMPLE RECOVERED. REPEAT: SAMPLE RECOVERED. PROCEEDING TO STAGE THREE.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œAny idea what that means?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t,â€� Miller said, pushing the terminal back. â€œExceptâ€¦ if the payload sample is Julieâ€™s body.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhich I think we can assume it is,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Miller tapped his fingertips on thler  kipse tabletop, unconsciously copying Holdenâ€™s rhythm, his mind working through the combinations.</p>
      <p>â€œThis thing,â€� Miller said. â€œThe bioweapon or whatever. They were shipping it here. So now itâ€™s here. Okay. Thereâ€™s no reason to take out Eros. Itâ€™s not particularly important to the war when you hold it up to Ceres or Ganymede or the shipyard at Callisto. And if you wanted it dead, thereâ€™re easier ways. Blow a big fusion bomb on the surface, and crack it like an egg.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not a military base, but it is a shipping hub,â€� Naomi said. â€œAnd, unlike Ceres, itâ€™s not under OPA control.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™re shipping her out, then,â€� Holden said. â€œTheyâ€™re taking their sample out to infect whatever their original target was, and once theyâ€™re off the station, thereâ€™s no way weâ€™re going to stop it.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shook his head. Something about the chain of logic felt wrong. He was missing something. His imaginary Julie appeared across the room, but her eyes were dark, black filaments pouring down her cheeks like tears.</p>
      <p>What am I looking at here, Julie? he thought. Iâ€™m seeing something here, but I donâ€™t know what it is.</p>
      <p>The vibration was a slight, small thing, less than a transport tubeâ€™s braking stutter. A few plates rattled; the coffee in Naomiâ€™s cup danced in a series of concentric circles. Everyone in the hotel went silent with the sudden shared dread of thousands of people made aware of their fragility in the same moment.</p>
      <p>â€œOh-kay,â€� Amos said. â€œThe fuck was that?â€� and the emergency Klaxons started blaring.</p>
      <p>â€œOr possibly stage three is something else,â€� Miller said over the noise.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The public-address system was muddy by its nature. The same voice spoke from consoles and speakers that might have been as close as a meter from each other or as far out as earshot would take them. It made every word reverberate, a false echo. Because of that, the voice of the emergency broadcast system enunciated very carefully, each word bitten off separately.</p>
      <p>â€œAttention, please. Eros Station is in emergency lockdown. Proceed immediately to the casino level for radiological safety confinement. Cooperate with all emergency personnel. Attention, please. Eros station is in emergency lockdownâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>And on in a loop that would continue, if no one coded in the override, until every man, woman, child, animal, and insect on the station had been reduced to dust and humidity. It was the nightmare scenario, and Miller did what a lifetime on pressurized rocks had trained him to do. He was up from the table, in the corridor, and heading down toward the wider passages, already clogged with bodies. Holden and his crew were on his heels.</p>
      <p>â€œThat was an explosion,â€� Alex said. â€œShip drive at the least. Maybe a nuke.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey are going to kill the station,â€� Holden said. There was a kind of awe in his voice. â€œI never thought Iâ€™d miss the part where they just blew up the ships I was on. But now itâ€™s stations.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey didnâ€™t crack it,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re sure of that?â€� Naomi asked.</p>
      <p>â€œI can hear you talking,â€� Miller said. â€œThat tells me thereâ€™s air.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThere are airlocks,â€� Holden said. â€œIf the station got holed and the locks closed downâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>A woman pushed hard against Millerâ€™s shoulder, forcing her way forward. If they werenâ€™t damn careful, there was going to be a stampede. This was too much fear and not enough space. It hadnâ€™t happened yet, but the impatient movement of the crowd, vibrating like molecules in water just shy of boiling, made Miller very uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>â€œThis isnâ€™t a ship,â€� Miller said. â€œItâ€™s a station. This is rock weâ€™re on. Anything big enough to get to the parts of the station with atmosphere would crack the place like an egg. A great big pressurized egg.â€�</p>
      <p>The crowd was stopped, the tunnel full. They were going to need crowd control, and they were going to need it fast. For the first time since heâ€™d left Ceres, Miller wished he had a badge. Someone pushed into Amosâ€™ side, then backed away through the press when the big guy growled.</p>
      <p>â€œBesides,â€� Miller said, â€œitâ€™s a rad hazard. You donâ€™t need air loss to kill everyone in the station. Just burn a few quadrillion spare neutrons through the place at C, and there wonâ€™t be any trouble with the oxygen supply.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCheerful fucker,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œThey build stations inside of rocks for a reason,â€� Naomi said. â€œNot so easy to force radiation through this many meters of rock.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI spent a month in a rad shelter once,â€� Alex said as they pushed through the thickening crowd. â€œShip I was on had magnetic containment drop. Automatic cutoffs failed, and the reactor kept runninâ€™ for almost a second. Melted the engine room. Killed five of the crew on the next deck up before they knew we had a problem, and it took them three days to carve the bodies free of the melted decking for burial. The rest of us wound up eighteen to a shelter for thirty-six days while a tug flew to get us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSounds great,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œEnd of it, six of â€™em got married, and the rest of us never spoke to each other again,â€� Alex said.</p>
      <p>Ahead of them, someone shouted. It wasnâ€™t in alarm or even anger, really. Frustration. Fear. Exactly the things Miller didnâ€™t want to hear.</p>
      <p>â€œThat may not be our big problem,â€� Miller said, but before he could explain, a new voice cut in, drowning out the emergency-response loop.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, everybody! Weâ€™re Eros security, que no? We got an emergency, so you do what we tell you and nobody gets hurt.â€�</p>
      <p>About time, Miller thought.</p>
      <p>â€œSo hereâ€™s the rule,â€� the new voice said. â€œNext asshole who pushes anyone, Iâ€™m going to shoot them. Move in an orderly fashion. First priority: orderly. Second priority is move! Go, go, go!â€�</p>
      <p>At first nothing happened. The knot of human bodies was tied too tightly for even the most heavy-handed crowd control to free quickly, but a minute later, Miller saw some heads far ahead of him in the tunnel start to shift, then move away. The air in the tunnel was thickening and the hot plastic smell of overloaded recyclers reached him just as the clot came free. Millerâ€™s breath started coming easier.</p>
      <p>â€œDo they have hard shelters?â€� a woman behind them asked her companion, and then was swept away by the currents. Naomi plucked Millerâ€™s sleeve.</p>
      <p>â€œDo they?â€� she asked.</p>
      <p>â€œThey should, yes,â€� Miller said. â€œEnough for maybe a quarter million, and essential personnel and medical crews would get first crack at them.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd everyone else?â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œIf they survive the event,â€� Holden said, â€œstation personnel will save as many people as they can.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAh,â€� Amos said. Then: â€œWell, fuck that. Weâ€™re going for the Roci, right?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOh, hell yes,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Ahead of them, the fast-shuffling crowd in their tunnel was merging with another flow of people from a lower level. Five thick-necked men in riot gear were waving people on. Two of them were pointing guns at the crowd. Miller was more than half tempted to go up and slap the little idiots. Pointing guns at people was a lousy way to avoid panic. One of the security men was also far too wide for his gear, the Velcro fasteners at his belly reaching out for each other like lovers at the moment of separation.</p>
      <p>Miller looked down at the floor and slowed his steps, the back of his mind suddenly and powerfully busy. One of the cops swung his gun out over the crowd. Another oneâ€”the fat guyâ€”laughed and said something in Korean.</p>
      <p>What had Sematimba said about the new security force? All bluster, no balls. A new corporation out of Luna. Belters on the ground. Corrupt.</p>
      <p>The name. Theyâ€™d had a name. CPM. Carne Por la Machina. Meat for the machine. One of the gun-wielding cops lowered his weapon, swept off his helmet, and scratched violently behind one ear. He had wild black hair, a tattooed neck, and a scar that went from one eyelid down almost to the joint of his jaw.</p>
