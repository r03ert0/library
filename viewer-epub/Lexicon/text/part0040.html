			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-First">Large areas of Washington, D.C., are in lockdown this evening following what authorities have described as a significant terrorism event.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Tactical police, military, and emergency biohazard response teams have flooded the downtown area and a major search appears underway, prompting speculation that one or more terrorists remain at large.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The Metropolitan Police Department is advising all D.C. residents to stay where they are and avoid all nonessential travel. “The city is essentially in lockdown tonight. People will not be getting anywhere,” said Chief of Police Roberta Martinez a short time ago. “I ask residents to bear with us during this time of crisis.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Authorities have yet to confirm whether an attack has taken place, saying only they are responding to “an incident.” However, unofficial sources are fearful that a chemical or biological weapon has been deployed.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">City workers described scenes of chaos as special operations soldiers and armored vehicles descended on the city.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">“They were herding everybody out, these guys with black helmets, goggles; people were screaming,” said Julia Treuel, 24, an office worker from iMax. “They looked like astronauts.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">It is estimated that as many as five thousand troops may already be on the ground in D.C. with more en route as the hunt for the terrorists intensifies.</p>
