			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Wil shouldered open the emergency room doors. After the darkness, the sunlight felt like an explosion. He gasped air. He made it to the white paramedic van and leaned against it. In one hand he had the thing. It was dark inside, but he hadn’t had trouble spotting it. A piece of wood, about the size of a book, with a piece of yellowed paper speared to it. He had left the paper in there. The wood was heavier than it looked and frigid to the touch, like it wanted to leech the heat from his body. There was a symbol on it that looked like nothing he had seen before, and the more he looked at it, the more something in his gut twisted, and his eyes watered, until he looked away. But it did not change him. It was true. He was immune.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He headed back to the Valiant. Then he stopped, because he couldn’t show this thing to Eliot. Eliot had been very clear about that. He glanced around for something to wrap it in. The doors of the paramedic van were open. He peered inside and found a small towel and shook the sand out of it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When he reached the car, Eliot’s eyes were closed. Wil pulled open the door. Eliot’s chest hitched and his eyes peeled open. “I did it,” Wil said. “I got the word.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot blinked.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right here,” he said, raising the towel, but Eliot’s eyes squeezed shut. “It’s okay! I covered it up. It’s a kind of symbol on a—” Eliot’s head jerked left and right. “I’m not telling you details! I’m describing the general kind of object!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ssss,” said Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know what happened here. Why everyone died. There was something stuck to the word that—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ssss!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay! I’m just saying, if you look at this thing, you won’t <em class="calibre1">die</em>. It’s not <em class="calibre1">fatal</em> anymore.” This didn’t seem to make any difference to Eliot. “You look terrible. Have you been drinking the water?” He spotted a bottle near Eliot’s feet, the lid off. The mat was wet. “Jesus, you haven’t.” He leaned over Eliot, looking for the other bottles. The smell in the car was very bad. “Drink.” He twisted the bottle’s top and held it to Eliot’s lips. Eliot’s throat clicked. His Adam’s apple bobbed. When water spilled down his chin, Wil lowered the bottle and waited until Eliot no longer seemed to be drowning. Then he said, “More,” and tipped it forward again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Gguh,” said Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have an idea. We drive to a hospital. A hospital with living people in it. Then I use this thing to make them help you. Right? I just word them. We tell them to help you but not tell anyone we’re there.” Eliot was leaking water again, so he put away the bottle. “Good plan?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot’s head turned left then right.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” Wil said. “What’s your plan, then? Because it’s pretty obvious to me that you’re dying. And we both know I don’t have a hope in hell against the people who are after us all by myself, even if I do have a magic word. So it’s either a hospital or I try a little amateur surgery on you myself with whatever I can find lying around. Do you want me to do that?” Eliot said nothing. “I’m not doing that. I’m getting you to a hospital.” He closed the door and jogged around to the driver’s seat. “Keep drinking the water.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He tucked the towel and its hidden package between the seats and turned the key. The engine clicked emptily. He blinked. He’d forgotten about the gas. He glanced at Eliot and saw Eliot looking at him with a complete lack of surprise.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shut up,” said Wil. He studied the roadway ahead, filled with bones and rusted metal. “I can find gas. I’ll be five minutes. Can you not die for five minutes?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot’s chin dropped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t lie to me. If I have to, I will cut you open.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ff,” said Eliot. “I. Fine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil eyed him. But he wouldn’t learn anything from Eliot’s face that Eliot did not want him to know. “Sure,” he said. “You’re fine.” He climbed out of the car.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He found a dust-coated SUV with keys in the ignition and gas in the tank. This was a much better option than trying to reintroduce life to the disintegrating piece of shit that was the Valiant, so he climbed in and steered around wrecked vehicles. The interior had an odd smell, which he tried not to think about. When he got close enough to the Valiant, he put the SUV into neutral and jumped out. Eliot seemed to have deteriorated in the meantime: His skin was papery, his eyes unfocused. “Hey!” Wil said. “I found a better car.” He pulled open Eliot’s door. “Throw your arm around me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You. Go. I. Stay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, that’s not what we’re doing. You’re coming with me. That’s the plan. We’re taking you to a hospital.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Bad. Plan,” said Eliot. “Gets you. Killed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have an alternative?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“North. Two miles. Dirt road. Then. Cross-country. Forty miles. To blacktop. Town. Kikaroo. Then. Any way. You want.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is there a hospital in Kikaroo? No. So we’re not doing that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Must.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I tell you what. Look me in the eye, tell me you believe I can do this without you, and I’ll leave you here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot eyed him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Unconvincing,” Wil said. “Put your goddamn arm around me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Get the fuck out of the car!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil leaned in to grab him. Eliot’s head pivoted to hit Wil in the nose: a small movement, but enough to knock him back, his vision flaring. “<em class="calibre1">Mother fuck!</em>” He turned in a circle. “You prick!” He lunged across Eliot and grabbed the towel. “I’ll fucking make you!” He began to unwrap it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">No.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The intensity of Eliot’s tone stopped him. “Then—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Never.” For a moment, Wil thought Eliot was climbing out of the car. But he was only leaning. “Never. On me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” Wil said, intimidated. “Point made, fine.” But then Eliot slumped back in his seat, becoming less terrifying and more fragile, and he changed his mind. “You know what? I am going to use it.” He peeled the towel from the petrified wood. It caught on a sharp protruberance and ripped. A noise came out of Eliot, something halfway between a snarl and a moan, and his head turned away. Wil had to twist him back to face the bareword, then realized Eliot’s eyes were closed. “Goddammit.” He tried to thumb up his eyelids while keeping a grip on the word. “Open up!” He forced open one eye. The pupil dilated and the fight drained from Eliot’s body. “Okay, now,” Wil said. “Get out of the car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot’s hand shot out and gripped the door frame. Wil retreated a step. Eliot’s other hand came out and twitched around like a spider until it found purchase. His body began to shake.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you, uh, okay there?” Wil said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Harrrgh</em>,” said Eliot. His expression was very intense. He was trying to pull himself out of the car, Wil realized. Straining, but lacking the strength to do it. Wil moved forward to help and realized that Eliot’s entire body was vibrating, his muscles tight bundles of wire.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There,” Wil said. Eliot straightened. He threw out a foot in a jerky, searching motion. Wil released him. Eliot fell to the pavement. “Oh, shit! Sorry!” Eliot’s hands scrabbled at the concrete. “Jesus! Eliot! Let me help you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Ghee.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He wrapped his arms around Eliot’s torso. “Come on. This way.” After four steps, Eliot vomited. His eyes were wide and staring, the pupils milky. He looked dead. “Eliot, I’m sorry. But it’s just a little farther.” Eliot’s foot slid out and Wil maneuvered it to touch the ground. “That’s it.” Eliot made a noise like it might become a cough one day. “Please, Eliot.” Eliot was not going to make it. He was already dead, and Wil was making him walk to an SUV. “I’m so sorry. But I can’t let you die.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Haargh.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t die! Do not die!” He was still holding the bareword and tried to wave it in Eliot’s face. Whether Eliot could even see anymore, Wil didn’t know. “<em class="calibre1">Don’t die.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot’s body convulsed. Flecks of spittle flew from his mouth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck!” he said. They were inching toward the paramedic van, and Wil wondered if there was a sedative in there, something in a syringe, which he could use to knock Eliot out. Then Eliot would stop being so much like a reanimated corpse. “Come with me!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He propped Eliot against the rear of the van and Eliot keeled over. Wil climbed inside anyway and began ransacking drawers. The sensation that he had been here before descended again, more strongly this time. He could feel memories scratching at the underside of his mind, just out of reach. But he didn’t have time for that. Eliot was lying in the dust and Wil had to get him to the SUV. He should use a fireman’s carry. Why had he been shuffling along, holding Eliot by the arm? That was stupid. You wanted to move someone, you put them over your shoulders. Everyone knew that. Anyone in emergency services had practiced in drills a hundred times. He looked around the van. This vehicle wasn’t just familiar. It was his.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He crawled past the trolley and into the cabin, dropping into the driver’s seat. He put his hands on the wheel. Eliot was bleeding to death back there. But it was calling to him. He had the feeling he was a paramedic.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He popped open the compartment between the seats and rummaged through the junk inside. Among the loose change and plastic wrappers was a yellowed newsletter. He glanced at it and almost tossed it aside before realizing the picture on the front was of him. He looked different. He was standing with a bunch of other people in front of the emergency room. Everything was clean and bright. His hair was long. He had a tan. His shoulders were broader. He was relaxed in a way that Wil couldn’t ever remember feeling. He read the caption and counted the figures from left to right, to be sure. HARRY WILSON. That was him. His name had been Harry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Behind him, Eliot coughed. Wil thought, <em class="calibre1">That guy has lost a lot of blood</em>. He blinked. For some reason, he hadn’t attended to Eliot’s gunshot wound. He was letting him bleed out, apparently. He felt bewildered. Why had he let Eliot go so long?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He climbed back through the van and manhandled Eliot into the bed. Eliot groaned. That was a positive sign. Well. It was a sign. He ransacked the shelves for a scalpel, surgical gloves, dressing, and saline, all of which were in their assigned places, rolled Eliot on his side, stuck the scalpel between his teeth, and forced Eliot’s knee up and his arm over. He cut away the shirt and there it was, an exit wound, big as his hand, pink and torn and oozing blood. He was appalled at himself. Timely first aid would have saved this guy’s life. All he could do now was compress and close anything that looked like it was fountaining blood.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He inserted a finger into Eliot’s lower intestine and gently lifted. There was a sucking noise, a <em class="calibre1">glunk</em>, and a small sea of Eliot flowed onto the back of his hand, which was bad, about the worst thing he could see, because that meant Eliot had holes. To locate the source he had to force four fingers in there, and Eliot made a terrible sound. Wil did what he could. It was not much but maybe enough. He began to dress the wound.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As he did, memories burst in his head like popping corn. Tiny, irrelevant things. The look on a girl’s face. The smell of earth in the morning. But they were coming. Squeezing past whatever barrier had been erected in his head. Something important came to him, and he paused.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot breathed. He was unconscious. His face was gray. The problem was too much of Eliot was spread across two different vehicles. Eliot was on his shirt and his coat and on the floor of two different vehicles. He was about a hair’s breadth away from hypovolemic shock and there was nothing Wil could do about that. He looked out the back of the van at the emergency room. Twenty feet from a hospital that was full of blood product, and every pack would be black and hard as stone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He leaned forward. “Eliot.” He twisted Eliot’s ear. This was extremely painful, if you did it properly. “Eliot, you motherfucker.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot groaned.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot.” He put his lips to Eliot’s ear. “Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Uh,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s your blood type?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Eliot opened his eyes. There was a ceiling. Tiled. A false ceiling: the kind that had pipes and wiring snaking through it. He didn’t know where he was, or when.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He heard a <em class="calibre1">crack</em>. He tensed. His abdomen hurt. There was a lot of pain in his body. He tried to raise his head and his vision swam. He saw pale blue walls and a cracked ceiling. A corded phone implanted into one wall. Chairs, a bedside table. A bed, for that matter, in which he was lying. The air smelled of dust.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Oh, Christ</em>, he thought. <em class="calibre1">I’m in Broken Hill.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He explored his surroundings with his hands. Something tugged on his arm, which turned out to be a tube. He was attached to something. He levered himself up his pillow, inch by inch, and saw a hat stand, draped with tubing and three bags. One of the bags bulged with clear fluid, one had dark fluid, and one appeared to have contained dark fluid until recently but was now mostly empty. He felt bewildered, because he didn’t remember any of this.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A second <em class="calibre1">crack</em>. This time he identified it as a gunshot. A rifle. His thoughts began to order themselves. He had driven to Broken Hill with the outlier, Wil. A farmer had shot him. When he’d realized the wound was fatal, he’d told Wil to leave him. But Wil hadn’t wanted to. It had been one of those frustrating situations where Eliot had needed to convince Wil of something but couldn’t, because the guy was an outlier. Also, stupidly stubborn. Eliot had passed out before this was really resolved. It seemed that in the meantime, Wil had saved his life.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He heard footsteps. He lay still until he was sure they were approaching, then began to feel around for a weapon. As Eliot saw it, there were two plausible scenarios. In one, Wil had driven away with the bareword, as Eliot had instructed, and the footsteps belonged to someone from the organization, coming to kill him. In the other, they belonged to Wil, who had been too cowardly to leave, and instead hung around hoping Eliot would wake up and tell him what to do. Either way, Eliot felt the need to shoot someone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The deadliest object he could see was the hat stand, which could possibly serve as a club. He tugged at the covers to free his legs. He hadn’t progressed very far with this when a man appeared in the doorway. The man had a rifle slung over his shoulder and for a second Eliot didn’t recognize him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Lie down,” Wil said. He crossed the room and peered out the window.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot sunk into the pillow, crushed by the weight of his own bitter disappointment. He shouldn’t have expected any different. Wil had done nothing Eliot asked of him from the moment they met. Eliot had been foolish to think he would start now just because everything depended on it. He plucked at the blanket. “We . . . leave. Now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil ignored him. He was looking at something outside. Eliot couldn’t tell what.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Listen, you . . . fuck,” said Eliot. “Woolf . . . is coming.” He tried to say more, but it degenerated into coughing. When he opened his eyes, Wil was holding a cup of water. Eliot took it. There was something different about Wil’s manner. The reason Eliot hadn’t recognized Wil before: Wil was different somehow. Eliot had the odd, discombobulating thought: <em class="calibre1">That isn’t Wil Parke.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Wil-person watched him drink without expression. When Eliot finished, he said, “Lie down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Have to—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re about to pass out again,” said the Wil-person. “Lie down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He felt the truth of this but fought it anyway. “Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You mean Emily. Emily Ruff.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Oh, God</em>, Eliot thought.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t think you mentioned that. You talked a lot about Woolf. But you never mentioned that I knew her. Knew her pretty well, as it turns out.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I . . . can . . . explain.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah,” said Wil. “You’ll explain. But first, you’re going to sleep.” He hefted the rifle. “I need to shoot some guys.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">What guys?</em> Eliot tried to say. But unconsciousness got him first.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He fell into sleep, but not far. He remembered a phone ringing in the dark. It had been a while ago. But he had been lying down, like this, feeling Broken Hill all around him. He had opened his eyes and seen curtains. A bedside clock. <em class="calibre1">Hotel</em>, he’d remembered. <em class="calibre1">I’m in a bed, in a hotel, in Sydney.</em> The phone rang and rang but he hadn’t moved in case it dissolved, revealing that he was back on that road, his face in the dirt, lying still.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He picked up the phone. “Your wake-up call, Mr. Eliot. It’s four thirty.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thank you.” He placed the receiver back on the cradle, carefully, and it did not dissolve. He rose and drew back the curtains. Beyond was the city: the famous Sydney Opera House wreathed in light; behind that, the hulking steel bridge. A few boats on the bay, lights bobbing. These things were comforting to him, the water, the steel, because they proved it was not three weeks ago, when Broken Hill had died around him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He showered and dressed. A newspaper lay outside his hotel room door and he stepped over it. Downstairs, a limo idled for him, the bellhop already moving to open its door. The city’s winding streets slid by, tinted dark, then the bay, as they crossed the bridge and navigated the zoo. On a narrow road, dark waves lapped at rocks. The limousine finally drew to a halt beside a set of steep steps and the driver indicated that Eliot should ascend them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the top was a colonial house. There was a terra-cotta plaza, lit by a dozen craftily concealed garden lights, with a small ornate table and chairs, and on one of these was Yeats.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Before you come any closer,” Yeats said, “take a look at the water.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He turned to look. The bay was a black mirror; he wasn’t sure what he was supposed to notice. He turned back to Yeats.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s good to see you.” Yeats had risen silently while Eliot’s back was turned and was now coming at him with a hand outstretched. Eliot took it. As always, Yeats was about as readable as a wooden fence. Within the organization, there was conjecture as to whether he’d had cosmetic surgery to paralyze his face. Eliot tended to think yes, because he knew Yeats had a personal surgeon, but occasionally he saw a contracting procerus or occipitofrontalis and doubted himself. “How are you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I was briefly paralyzed three weeks ago,” he said. “Since then, I’ve been fine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats gestured to a seat. “No lingering effects?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not since sunrise on the second day.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“As she instructed. Fascinating. To be honest, I remain shocked that a poet of your caliber could succumb to it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“‘It.’” He sat. “Let’s call it what it is. A bareword.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Apparently so.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’ll excuse me,” Eliot said, “but I’m feeling somewhat put upon.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How so?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You sent me to Broken Hill without telling me what I was dealing with.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I believe I told you it was high-testing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s high testing,” Eliot said, “and then there’s <em class="calibre1">that thing</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was silence. “Well,” said Yeats, “obviously its efficacy took us by surprise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A woman appeared and began to generate tea and coffee. Eliot waited. When she left, he said, “Are we going to talk plainly?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats spread his palms.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You arrived in Broken Hill within hours. Clearly, you were nearby. Clearly, information has been kept from me. I want to know why. Because I’m having trouble understanding what I did to deserve less trust than <em class="calibre1">Plath</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What was it like?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What was what like?” he said, although he knew.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Quick, I imagine. But you must have perceived something. A split second of vanishing awareness. A grasping at a shrinking light.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It was like being fucked in the brain.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I wonder if you can be more specific.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You had this thing in DC. I’m sure you have plenty of data from those poor fucks you put through the labs.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Some. But I wish to hear it from you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked out at the black water. “Regular compromise feels like sharing the cockpit. Like there’s someone else in there with you, flipping switches behind your back. This gave me no sensation of being able to regain control. None at all. It felt like being worn. By something primal.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Moments passed. “Well,” said Yeats. “For that I apologize. It was not my intention to sacrifice you. Indeed, I selected you precisely because I consider you my most able colleague, and most likely to stop her. As for why I kept my whereabouts from you, I confess that was insurance against the possibility that Woolf would turn you against me. A selfish decision. But I have no wish to square off against you, Eliot. The very idea terrifies me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He let this pass. In the distance, an animal, unidentifiable, made a very Australian sound. “So we have a bareword.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The first in eight hundred years,” Yeats said. “It’s rather exciting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where is it now?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats shrugged slightly. “Where she left it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Pardon me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We haven’t recovered it,” Yeats said. “It’s still in the hospital somewhere, apparently.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Apparently?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Local authorities have sent in several teams, none of which have made it out. I presume it’s the word that’s killing them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He took a moment to compose himself. “It’s surprising to me that you haven’t taken all necessary steps to recover it. I cannot express how surprising that is.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Mmm,” said Yeats. He gazed into the darkness awhile. “Let me ask you a question. If the word is so powerful, why did those who wielded it fall? For they did fall; the stories are united on that. In every case, the appearance of a bareword is followed by a Babel event, in which rulers are overthrown and a common tongue abandoned. In modern terms, it would be like losing English. Imagine the sum total of our organization’s work, gone. Our entire lexicon wiped out. And yet apparently this has happened. Apparently it happens following each discovery of a bareword, without fail. Is that not curious?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“All empires fall, eventually.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But why? It’s not for lack of power. In fact, it seems to be the opposite. Their power lulls them into comfort. They become undisciplined. Those who had to earn power are replaced by those who have known nothing else. Who have no comprehension of the need to rise above base desires. Power corrupts, as the saying goes, and the bareword, Eliot, is not only absolute power, but worse: It is unearned. I need do nothing to possess it other than pick it up. This troubles me. I ask myself: If I seize the bareword, do I remain as I am? Or does it corrupt me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have no idea,” he said. “But I’m pretty certain we can’t leave it in the fucking desert.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats was silent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He leaned forward. “Bring it back home. Seal it up. Christ, sink it in concrete. Bury it for another eight hundred years.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats glanced away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We don’t need it,” Eliot said. “Unless you have an urge to build a tower.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There is another issue. Woolf escaped.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He closed his eyes. It was unprofessional but he needed to do it. “How is that possible?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“She’s quite resourceful,” Yeats said. “As I believe you know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The newspapers said nobody made it out alive.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Surely you didn’t trust them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where is she?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have no idea.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have no idea?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“As I said,” said Yeats, “resourceful. She managed to get someone out, too.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Who?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Presumably, the man she went back for.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Harry?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes, that name sounds familiar.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So let me get this straight,” he said. “There’s a bareword in Broken Hill. The whereabouts of the poet who used it to kill three thousand people remain unknown. Am I missing anything?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No,” said Yeats. “I believe that’s everything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I feel I must be missing something,” he said, “since this situation is insane.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats was silent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The bareword must be recovered. Woolf must be neutralized. Surely you see that this is indisputable.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats tested his tea. “Yes. You are correct, of course. It shall be done.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For some reason, Eliot didn’t believe him. “I’ll find Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Actually, you will return to DC. Your flight is booked. You depart this afternoon.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He shook his head. “I want to stay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How are you, Eliot?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You already asked me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I ask again, because this is the second time in our conversation that you have used the word <em class="calibre1">want</em>. Were you a third-year student, I would be appalled.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll rephrase. It’s important to neutralize Woolf and I’m the best we have.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But how are you?” Yeats’s eyes held his. “She has shaken you. I see it plainly. Was it the bareword? No. Something else. You were always too close to her. You developed affection. Why, I have no idea. But it clouded your judgment then and continues to do so now. You feel betrayed. You are infected with the desire to atone for your failure to stop her in Broken Hill.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s how you see what happened? As my failure?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Of course not. I speak of how you see it.” Yeats gazed across the bay, to where soft fingers of sunlight edged over forested hills. “A tragedy like this, we all blame ourselves.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Do we,</em> Eliot thought. “I strongly believe I should stay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That is why you cannot.” The sun bloomed along the tree line of the far hill, throwing spears into the bay. “Ah,” said Yeats. “Here we are. Watch.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A menagerie of animal voices rose to greet the light, hooting and cawing. Where sunlight touched it, the water flared bright blue. It took Eliot a moment to realize that the glittering wasn’t a visual effect: The waters were moving.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Kingfish,” said Yeats. “The light draws the plankton, the plankton draws smaller fish. The minnows draw the kingfish. More precisely, the kingfish are already there, waiting, since they are intelligent enough to perceive patterns and draw inferences.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot didn’t respond.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats sighed. “Stay. Search this country for Woolf, if that is what’s required to regain control of your conscience.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He turned these words over. He couldn’t tell whether they were a kindness or a threat. But there was no denying how he felt. “Thank you,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He sensed light. At first he thought it was the sunlight on the bay. Then he opened his eyes. The light was coming through windows. Between the windows stood Wil. Wil with a rifle. The walls were a pale hospital blue. He was in Broken Hill.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Morning,” said Wil.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What,” said Eliot. “Time. Is it.” He began to extract himself from the sheets.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re going to want to stay in that bed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. Definitely. Not.” He got his legs over the side. This caused some flaring of his vision and a looseness in his head, and he took a few moments to sit quietly, eyes closed. When he opened them, Wil was pointing the rifle at something outside. Eliot remembered the noise he’d heard before: <em class="calibre1">crack.</em> “What are you doing?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil didn’t answer. He was holding that rifle very naturally, Eliot noticed. The barrel followed whatever Wil was tracking in a smooth line, like an extension of his body. Then it jerked. Wil stepped back against the wall, pulling back the rifle’s bolt and reloading it with a cartridge from his jeans. “It’s about six in the morning.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot felt disbelief. If that were true, Woolf would be here already. The town would be flooded with proles, or EIPs, or poets, or all three. It couldn’t be morning because they were still alive. “We have to leave.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re not going anywhere, Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We—” he began, but Wil raised the rifle very quickly, and Eliot fell silent. Wil’s body became completely still. The rifle jerked. Eliot said, “Please tell me what you think you’re doing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shooting guys.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What guys?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Proles, I guess.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re shooting proles,” Eliot said. “I see. When it’s a guy in a chopper and I ask you to shoot him, you won’t. But now you’re shooting proles.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil moved from one window to the other.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There isn’t a limited supply,” Eliot said. “If you haven’t figured that out. She’ll send as many as it takes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Who? Emily?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Oh, yes</em>, Eliot thought. Wil had remembered. That was why he was handling a rifle like he’d used it all his life: because he had. “What do you think you’re doing, Wil?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Harry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“My name is Harry Wilson.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right,” Eliot said. “Of course, my mistake—what the fuck are you doing, Harry?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Waiting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Waiting for . . .” His mind reeled. “For <em class="calibre1">her</em>?” Wil, or Harry, or whoever he was, didn’t answer. But clearly yes. Clearly he had a terrible, ill-informed notion of the situation, which was going to get them both killed. It was Eliot’s fault, of course. Like everything else. “She isn’t who you think.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is she Emily Ruff?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” Eliot said, “Woolf is Emily Ruff. But—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You understand why I have a problem with that. The whole thing with you wanting to kill her.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you aware you’re acting like a different person? As in, a completely different person?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I remembered.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” Eliot said, “but I regret to inform you that what you’re remembering is no longer valid, because when you changed, so did she. She is no longer the girl you used to hang with in Broken Hill and share milk shakes and ride kangaroos or whatever the fuck. Now she kills people. She is coming to kill us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t believe you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why would I lie about this?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Charlotte.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He searched for the words. “You think that’s why I hate Woolf? Because of Montana?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry shrugged.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, fuck!” Eliot said. “You got me! Since she made me shoot the woman I loved, I’ve been carrying a grudge! Jesus fucking Christ!” He dragged a hand across his brow. Harry regarded him expressionlessly, and this absurdity, the stillness of the man he knew as Wil Parke while Eliot raged, was not lost on him. He’d been a poet, once. “There is the little fact that Woolf was a murderous bitch who was hunting us both even before that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You lied to me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What was I supposed to do? You’re the only outlier! I didn’t have the option of finding one who hadn’t slept with her. Wil, I get that you’re pissed. I do. But look at yourself. The instant you found out she used to be Emily, you gave up. I’m sorry I lied to you. But that doesn’t change the fact that we have to stop Woolf. We have to. What can I say to convince you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t want you to say anything. I want you to sit there and wait until she gets here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot sank into the bed. It was pointless. Every technique he knew, useless, because Harry could not be persuaded.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What happened to her?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“After Broken Hill.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked at the ceiling. “She disappeared. I searched for months.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then,” said Eliot, “she came back.”</p>
