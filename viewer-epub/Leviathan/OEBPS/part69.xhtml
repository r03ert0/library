      <h2>â€œHe was kind of a pain in the ass, wasnâ€™t he?â€� Holden...</h2>
      <p>â€œThat man could take a visitation from God with thirty underdressed angels announcing that sex was okay after all and make it seem vaguely depressing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe was a good man,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œHe wasnâ€™t,â€�gn="ju c€™t Fred said. â€œBut he did his job. And now Iâ€™ve got to go do mine.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGive â€™em hell,â€� Holden said. â€œAnd amnesty. Keep talking up the amnesty.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred walked down the curving hallway, his secretary close behind him. The conference halls had been designed for smaller things. Petty ones. Hydroponics scientists getting away from their husbands and wives and children to get drunk and talk about raising bean sprouts. Miners coming together to lecture each other about waste minimization and tailings disposal. High school band competitions. And instead, these work carpets and brushed-stone walls were going to have to bear the fulcrum of history. It was Holdenâ€™s fault that the shabby, small surroundings reminded him of the dead detective. They hadnâ€™t before.</p>
      <p>The delegations were seated across the aisle from each other. The generals and political appointees and general secretaries of Earth and Mars, the two great powers together at his invitation to Ceres, to the Belt. Territory made neutral because neither side took it seriously enough to be concerned about their demands.</p>
      <p>All of history had brought them here, to this moment, and now, in the next few minutes, Fredâ€™s job was to change that trajectory. The fear was gone. Smiling, he stepped up to the speakerâ€™s dais, the podium.</p>
      <p>The pulpit.</p>
      <p>There was a scattering of polite applause. A few smiles, and a few frowns. Fred grinned. He wasnâ€™t a man anymore. He was a symbol, an icon. A narrative about himself and about the forces at play in the solar system.</p>
      <p>And for a moment, he was tempted. In that hesitation between drawing breath and speaking, part of him wondered what would happen if he shed the patterns of history and spoke about himself as a man, about the Joe Miller who heâ€™d known briefly, about the responsibility they all shared to tear down the images they held of one another and find the genuine, flawed, conflicted people they actually were.</p>
      <p>It would have been a noble way to fail.</p>
      <p>â€œLadies and gentlemen,â€� he said. â€œWe stand at a crossroads. On one hand, there is the very real threat of mutual annihilation. On the otherâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>He paused for effect.</p>
      <p>â€œOn the other, the stars.â€�</p>

      <p>interview</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Leviathan Wakes is the first book in a series called The Expanse. What kind of story are you telling in this series?</p>
      <p>Thereâ€™s a lot of science fiction that talks about tence f fhe near future. Thereâ€™s a lot about great galaxy-spanning empires of the distant future. But thereâ€™s not much that talks about the part in between. The Expanse is playing on that bridge. Whatever drives us off Earth to the rest of the solar system or from there to the stars, the problems we have are the ones we bring with us. What I want to do is write good old-fashioned space opera centered around human stories, but with an increasingly large backdrop.</p>
      <p>It seems like Leviathan Wakes is a science fiction book, but it borrows from a lot of other genres as well, including horror and noir. Did you intend to blend those genres? What kind of book do you feel this is?</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s definitely science fiction of the old-school space opera variety. Thatâ€™s the story I wanted to tell. But half of the story was a detective story, and as soon as Detective Miller hit the page, he told me in a loud voice that he was a classic noir character. It was in his voice and the way he talked about things, you know? As for the horror feel, thatâ€™s just the way I roll. Iâ€™ve never written anything in my life that didnâ€™t at least blur the line into horror. If I wrote greeting cards, theyâ€™d probably have a squick factor.</p>
      <p>Leviathan Wakes has two protagonists with very different worldviews, which are often in conflict. Can you describe those views and why you chose that particular conflict?</p>
      <p>You know how they say science fiction is about the future youâ€™re writing about, but itâ€™s also about the time youâ€™re writing in? Holden and Miller have got two different views on the ethical use of information. Thatâ€™s very much a current argument. Holdenâ€™s my holy fool. Heâ€™s an idealist, a man who faces things with this very optimistic view of humanity. He believes that if you give people all of the information, theyâ€™ll do the right thing with it, because people are naturally good. Miller is a cynic and a nihilist. He looks at the dissemination of information as a game you play. He doesnâ€™t have faith in anyone elseâ€™s moral judgment. Control of information is how you get people to do what you want, and he doesnâ€™t trust anyone else to make that call. I picked those two characters because theyâ€™re both right, and theyâ€™re both wrong. By having them in the same story, I can have them talk to each other. And that central disagreement is sort of underneath everything else that happens.</p>
