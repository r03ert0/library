			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">She tried to catch Harry at inconvenient moments. When he was stepping into the shower, or just after he closed his eyes at night, or reaching for the car door, late for work. “Do you love me?” she would ask. She would smile, so he’d know she was teasing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Maybe,” he would say. Or nothing. Sometimes the look he gave her was like: <em class="calibre1">Of course, why ask?</em> and other times it was more like: <em class="calibre1">Stop it, I’m running late</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He did love her. She was sure of it. All evidence pointed to yes. So why not say it? This was the part that nagged at her. Yes, okay, in Harry’s world, you didn’t need to say something to make it real. But come on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She had said it. She had said it a lot, starting three weeks ago and increasing in frequency since, with the exception of a four-day drought the week before, which she had hoped might trigger something but didn’t. And it was driving her crazy because she could force him. She didn’t have a lot of words, but she did have tricks, and had figured out his segment, and there was no doubt in her mind that she could compel Harry Wilson to say whatever she wanted. But if she did that, it wouldn’t be real. It wouldn’t be him. It would be her, speaking to herself, through him. It was very frustrating.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">“That car has been all over town,” said the woman who was making Emily a sandwich. Emily turned. Across the street sat a dark sedan, windows tinted, engine running against the heat. A skirt of dust betrayed some serious long-haul driving. “You see it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not from around here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.” She looked at the sandwich that the woman, Cheryl, was making. She had visited this shop nearly every weekday lunchtime for the past four years. She had practically married Cheryl’s sandwiches.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s been to the mines.” Cheryl gestured with the knife. “Look at the tires.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She looked. The tires were caked in red earth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Someone from the city, I suppose. Government.” Cheryl flipped the bread. “Salt and pepper, love?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, thanks.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I keep thinking you might change your mind,” said Cheryl, sawing bread. “I can’t imagine how you eat it so plain.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I like plain,” she said. She carried the sandwich out of the shop, although she no longer felt like eating it. The car crouched in her peripheral vision but she did not look at it. When it pulled out, she crossed into the pedestrian mall, where it could not follow, and walked the roundabout route to Tangled Threads. She locked the door and sat behind the counter. She didn’t know how to feel. Two years ago, maybe even one, she would have chased that car down the road. She would have beaten her hands against its side and begged it to stop. But now things were different.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A young man in an airy gray suit appeared at the door. He pulled the handle, pushed it, then put his hand to the glass and peered inside. When he saw her, he pointed at the handle and mouthed: <em class="calibre1">Open?</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She unlocked. He was young; a boy, really. She could tell from his skin that he had come from nowhere near here. “Thanks,” he said. He came inside. He brushed aside his hair, which was a style she didn’t know and dangled in his eyes. “Whoo. Hot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What can I help you with today?” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He smiled, as if he appreciated the pretense. “It’s good news. You can come home.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She said nothing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He glanced out the window. “That was a genuinely long drive. They told me it was long, but . . . it’s really something. Or nothing, rather.” He looked at her. “Nothing and nothing, for as far as you go. Did you get used to it?” She didn’t answer. “It seems to me it would be hard to get used to.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can get used to anything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Of course,” he said. “We can leave right away.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Today?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is that a problem?” His eyes were gray, like his suit.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head. She did not want problems. “Give me your phone number. I’ll call you in a couple hours.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I wouldn’t bother packing. There’s nothing here you’ll need again.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If I don’t tell people I’m leaving, they’ll look for me. I’ll be reported missing. It will get messy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He was silent. He was going to tell her the organization could handle a missing persons report. But then he shrugged. “As you like.” He dug in his pockets. Had this boy attended the school? He might have been one of the kids, a skinny cavorting stick boy too small to register. But she wasn’t sure. It all seemed so long ago. “You really made yourself a part of this place, huh?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s small,” she said. “There’s no other way.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He smiled like he didn’t believe her and extended her a card. “I’ll be in the car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She phoned the owner of Tangled Threads, Mary, and said she needed to leave right away, her mother was dying. Mary’s voice flooded with sympathy and told Emily it was fine, take as much time as she needed. She said, “I didn’t know you were still in contact with your family.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I wasn’t,” said Emily. “I just heard from them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then she drove to the hospital and waited. She could never tell where Harry would be, but the best place to wait was the emergency room. Sometimes she sat and read magazines alongside farmers with their hands wrapped in black towels and mothers with green children. The emergency room had glass double doors and when the paramedic van pulled up, the sun bouncing off its white hood, it was always thrilling, like winning a prize.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But when she saw him, she burst into tears. It was unexpected and shocking and if that organization boy had been around to see it, who knew what would have happened. Harry came to her, alarmed, and she heard the lie fall out of her about a mother, cancer. She hugged him and inhaled him while she could.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you want me to come?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No,” she said, grateful for the offer. “You can’t.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How long will you be?” He shook his head. “You don’t know. It’s okay. Take your time.” He kissed her head. “But come back.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I will,” she said, and as the words came out, she was surprised at how true they felt. “I will, I promise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eventually she pulled away. There were people watching, and the longer this went on, the harder it became, so when he offered to drive her to the house she refused. She had to walk away while she could. “I love you,” she said, and he smiled sadly, and in retrospect, it was very obvious, wasn’t it? She should have seen it coming. But love made people stupid, and she was so very much in love. The emergency room doors parted and she walked through them and the only thing that made this bearable was the conviction that she’d be back.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">An hour later, she was in the black sedan, watching dust swallow Broken Hill in the side mirror. The boy brought the car up to ninety miles an hour and manipulated his phone with one hand. “Sleep, if you want,” he told her. “There’s a whole lot of nothing for the next eight hours.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This was true. But she couldn’t do it. The boy kept glancing at her and she curled up in the seat, putting her back to him. A while later, a car passed, heading in the opposite direction, gleaming on top and pancaked with dirt on the bottom. She watched it recede in the mirror. A minute later, there was another one just like it, then another.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are there more of you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hmm?” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The cars,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He shrugged. “Probably locals.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She slouched back down. A truck appeared on the road ahead, following the cars, a black eighteen-wheeler with no signage, hauling a steel container unlike any she’d ever seen, but this time she didn’t say anything.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The journey was thirty-four hours, long enough to develop a burning hate for the organization boy and everything he stood for. She was glad the first-class seats were like capsules, which gave her space to hide her misery. She didn’t know what had triggered the arrival of the boy, whether it was simply enough time passing for the organization to consider her suitably chastened, or they had been observing her, or something had happened, or what. But whichever it was, she would be expected to be in charge of her emotions.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She deplaned, disoriented and bruised somewhere in the core of her body, into DC winter sunshine. A limo whisked her to a grand hotel, where the boy bid her farewell, and she slept for fourteen hours. She woke to a blinking red light on the bedside phone. She pressed for voice mail, thinking it might be Eliot, which would be frightening, or Yeats, which would be more so, but it was neither. Instead, a girl she didn’t know told her she was expected at a particular fashion store in thirty minutes. The girl ended her message without saying good-bye, as if she’d been cut off, although Emily knew she hadn’t been.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She caught a cab downtown and tried on skirts and sheer shirts. In the mirror, she looked freakishly tan. “This will take more than a jacket,” said the man, who had introduced himself as a <em class="calibre1">personal style adviser</em>. “You’re a cavewoman in a suit, dear.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He forwarded her to a salon, where a bald man dragged a brush through her hair with occasional exclamations of dismay. Now she was alongside other women, she started to see the problem. Her hair was the wrong kind of blond: the kind from the sun. There was a gritty quality to her skin. She had absorbed Broken Hill. She had soaked it up and become savage. “Do not worry,” said the hairdresser. “We’ve beaten worse than this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Afterward, the floor a graveyard of fallen hair, she found herself with a short bob and bangs like a steel door. It seemed like they had tried to hide her face. She looked strange to herself. “Do you wear glasses?” asked the hairdresser. “You should consider that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She was shuttled back to the first clothing store, where her new look was praised effusively. She actually started to feel good and then the personal style adviser said, “Well, it’s an improvement, anyway.” She had forgotten how indirectly people spoke here. She had become accustomed to taking people literally.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Hours later, laden with shopping bags, she was driven to a tall glass office building that offered no identifying logo. She entered a simple lobby, feeling newly manufactured in her gray woolen suit and stiff black shoes, her heart pounding in case she was about to meet someone she knew. But there was no one. A red sofa, a few paintings; it could have been anywhere. She waited at the reception desk until a young man with invisible eyebrows emerged from the rear office. “I’m Emily Ruff,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just a moment.” When he returned, he had a plastic card, which he placed on the counter. It was blank but for: NL-L5D4. She looked at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That means level five, desk four.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” she said. “Thank you.” She hefted her bags. It took her a minute to figure out the elevators: She had to insert the card into a slot before the buttons would do anything. Then the doors closed and she rose toward whatever was up there.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">It turned out that level five was nothing but anonymous corporate space with a dozen or so roomy cubicles. Almost all were empty. It was very quiet and as her shopping bags rustled and banged she wished she’d left them with the receptionist. She passed a young woman on the phone and a boy with long hair and glasses who looked up from his computer screen but his expression didn’t change and she didn’t stop walking.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She spotted identifying plates on the desk corners and began to triangulate D4. It was in a corner, with a pretty amazing view over south DC. It had a chair, a phone, a computer, and that was it. She stashed her bags beneath the desk and tested the chair. She waited. The phone would ring, she guessed. Eventually.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After a minute, the boy with glasses appeared, accompanied by a girl whose hair was the good kind of blond. She looked familiar, although Emily couldn’t place her. She seemed very young. “Wow. Welcome.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hi,” she said. “Thank you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Isaac Rosenberg,” the boy said. “Nice to meet you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m Raine,” said the girl. “Kathleen Raine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hi,” Emily said again. There was an awkward silence. “I’m sorry, I don’t know why I’m here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Typical,” said the boy, Rosenberg. “We only got word a couple days ago that you were coming. You’re in NL.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Neurolinguistics?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He nodded. “Testing and Measurement. Have you done any NL work before?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s good for a theoretical grounding, supposedly. Anyway, we’ll get you started. Teach you the system. If that’s okay with you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure,” she said. The girl, Raine, was still looking at her like she was missing something, so she said, “I’m sorry, have we met?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Several expressions flitted across the girl’s face in quick succession, one of which said yes and another that told her she wasn’t supposed to ask. “No,” the girl said, but Emily remembered now: They had met at the school. Emily had forgotten because it was in that first week, and the girl had failed the tests and not been admitted. She had been very young. Emily had tried to make her feel better by saying she could try again the next year. Her name had been Gertie.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hey, I apologize if this is inappropriate,” said Rosenberg, “but they really haven’t told us much and we don’t want to tread on any toes, so I’m wondering if . . . you know, if you actually want to do NL or if we should just leave you alone.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think I’m actually here to do NL. I’m just another graduate now, I guess.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Rosenberg and Raine laughed, then stopped. “I’m sorry,” said Rosenberg. “I thought you were joking.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why would that be a joke?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean to imply anything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You haven’t. But please, tell me what you know about me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, nothing. Just your name.” He pointed to her partition. There was a gray rectangle of plastic. A nameplate she hadn’t noticed before. Her first thought was that she was at the wrong desk. Then she realized she wasn’t. Because of Yeats. Because four years ago, he had said: <em class="calibre1">I have a name for you, when the time is right</em>. The nameplate said: <span class="SCAP1">VIRGINIA WOOLF</span>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The woman on the phone she’d passed earlier turned out to be Sashona. The last time Emily had seen her was on the hockey field at the school. “Screw me sideways,” said Sashona. “You’re Woolf?” She looked at Emily with her hands on her hips. Sashona had grown up. She had become a woman. “We thought you’d <em class="calibre1">died.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Nope.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Holy cripes. Where have you been?” She shook her head before Emily could answer. “Don’t answer. Stupid question. Wow. Look at you. You’re so different.” Emily smiled awkwardly. She wasn’t sure that was a good thing. “What on earth did you do to earn that name?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sashona looked at her and Emily realized she did not believe this at all. “You look great.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You, too.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Patty Smith,” said Sashona. “That’s my name now. Smith.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, Smith’s good,” said Emily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ah, fuck off,” said Sashona, smiling. For a second it was like being back at school.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She was reminded how much she disliked neurolinguistics. She had forgotten that, since school. At first, it was fascinating; it was all Amazonian tribes using recognizably Latin words and how saying <em class="calibre1">guh</em> could make you hungry. Then came syntax and semantic violations and synaptic coupling. It required enormous amounts of rote memorization—all of which she’d lost over the past four years—and the ability to juggle symbols in her head. At school, students didn’t talk much about what they thought of specific subjects, but when she had mentioned she was studying neurolinguistics to Jeremy Lattern, he had looked sympathetic. This was like those classes again, only now she was expected to know everything.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Rosenberg and Raine taught her how to use the computer. There was a ticket system: When people wanted her to do something, they logged a ticket. And when she was finished, she plugged her work into the ticket and closed it. Mostly, the people who wanted Emily to do something were from Labs, which she gathered was located somewhere else in the building, although it was clear that other people were reading the tickets, too, because they sometimes requested clarifications. Those people, she thought, were higher-ups. Organization people like Eliot. But there were no names in the ticket system, only numbers. Sometimes she would read a ticket over and over, wondering if there was anything of Eliot’s mannerisms in it, but she could never tell for sure. After a while, she stopped expecting to see Eliot. Apparently she was to be left alone. To do what, exactly, she didn’t know. Maybe they really did want her to relearn NL. Maybe they were secretly observing her. But if this was the case, what they were observing was nothing very interesting.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She was assigned an apartment, a bank account, and a cell phone. All this was arranged. Her apartment balcony overlooked the meatpacking district and sometimes she stood out there with a bottle of wine, wrapped in a jacket that never really kept out the cold, watching the city breathe.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Every few days, she did something stupid. She stayed up late, or set the alarm early, and left the apartment in the freezing dark. She walked in a random direction for a random amount of time and found a pay phone and plugged coins into it. As it rang, she reminded herself to modulate her voice, avoid identifiable phrases, and end the call as soon as possible. She told herself, <em class="calibre1">This is the last time for at least a week</em>. Because if she was caught, she had no doubt that the consequences would be terrible. But then the line would connect, and Harry’s voice would fill her, and she would forget about that.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She got to visit Labs. It turned out to be in the bowels of the building, underground. It was brightly lit and full of techs in white coats and had two plastic, keypad-protected doors between her and anyone more senior than a receptionist. They interviewed people down here, she knew: attached them to probes and ran them through fMRIs to record what happened when they heard words. Then they sent the data upstairs to NL for analysis. Where these test subjects came from, she didn’t know. Although once while looking for a pay phone near George Washington University, she had seen a paper stapled to a light pole offering fifty dollars for volunteers for a psychology experiment, so maybe that. When the data came through the ticketing system, sometimes under OBERVABLE EFFECTS it said <em class="calibre1">psychotic break</em>, or <em class="calibre1">loss of function</em>, or <em class="calibre1">coma</em>. She tried not to think about this too much. But it was obvious that people got hurt down there.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Sashona—<em class="calibre1">Smith</em>, as Emily would never feel comfortable calling her—had changed a lot. She laughed, which she had never done at school, and found everything <em class="calibre1">amazing</em>. This struck Emily as unlikely behavior, since Sashona should have been guarding her personality to prevent segmentation. She decided it was feigned: a behavioral smoke screen. The higher levels didn’t do this; Emily had talked with Eliot plenty and had no idea of his segment simply because he gave nothing away. But it made sense for a newer poet. It made her wonder if she should be doing the same thing, and if Sashona thought Emily was trying to figure out her segment, and if Sashona was trying to figure out hers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One day, as a tall, handsome barista delivered coffees to their café table, Sashona opened her mouth and a snarl of unintelligible words tripped out. “Love me,” Sashona said, and the barista spilled the coffee and went away and came back to ask for Sashona’s phone number. This was how Emily discovered that in the four years she had been selling blouses in the desert, Sashona had been learning words. Emily murmured her appreciation, but the truth was she was shocked. She hadn’t realized how far behind she was. How was she supposed to catch up? She had no one to ask but Sashona, and although they were friendly, she was afraid to expose her ignorance.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She decided to hope that one day somebody would appear to educate her. In the meantime, she read data and tried to pound it into thoughtful conclusions. The organization was interested in refining its psychographic model, in finding ever-better ways to classify people more accurately into fewer segments. She looked for responses in graphs that shouldn’t be there, tiny bumps in blue lines, and wrote reports on possible psychographic overlaps, and segment boundary blurring, and possible new avenues for segmentation. She had access to a vast database of shopping habits, Internet usage patterns, traffic flows, and more; if she wanted, she could drill right down to an individual and look up where they went last Tuesday and what they bought and did. But that was not very useful. No one was interested in individuals. She was supposed to look for connections between them: neurological commonalities that allowed them to be grouped together and targeted by a common word. Whether anybody acted on her work, or even read it, she had no idea.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It became harder to find a pay phone she hadn’t used to call Harry before. Every night, as she walked the streets, she half-expected Eliot or Yeats or maybe that kid in the airy suit to step out of the darkness. And then everything would be over. But that never happened, so she kept doing it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">One day she got a corrupted data set from a ticket, so she picked up the phone and dialed Labs. She was not supposed to do this. At least, she was supposed to do it as little as possible. Techs were isolated from analysts for security reasons, since techs were not poets and were therefore vulnerable to compromise. Why an analyst might want to compromise a tech, she had no idea. It seemed pretty pointless. But that was the rule. It didn’t seem very effective, either, since although the techs were supposed to be anonymous, they gave themselves away in their writing styles: one overused <em class="calibre1">evidently</em>, one had never heard of apostrophes, that kind of thing. So she did not have a great deal of respect for the rule.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hello,” she said when Labs picked up. “This is Analyst three-one-nine. I need a validation check on a data set, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Open a ticket,” said a male voice. She had seen no evidence of women in Labs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I did open a ticket, and it came back the same. I want it done again.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s your ticket number?” She told him. There was a pause. “That data set has been recompiled.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know it’s been recompiled. But I want it re-recompiled, because it’s still wrong.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The data set is accurate.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Guy,” she said, “I’m looking at it right now. The p-graph is blank. I don’t know if you’ve got a format error, missing data, or what, but the graph cannot be blank.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s not blank.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She opened her mouth, because that was preposterous. She had seen thousands of p-graphs and knew what they were supposed to look like: mountain ranges. Sometimes they had many peaks, sometimes just one, but the point was they were jagged. The lines went up and down. But as she looked at it again, she realized Labs was right. There was a line. She hadn’t noticed because it ran along the very top of the grid and was dead straight.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Clear?” said Labs.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” she said. “Thank you.” She put down the phone. She looked at the graph awhile.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She walked to Sashona’s desk. “Hey,” she said. “What’s synapsis?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s the context?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s in a new ticket. After ‘subject response,’ instead of a rating, it says ‘synapsis.’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, <em class="calibre1">synapsis</em> is just compromise,” said Sashona. “But they shouldn’t use that term. That’s sloppy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s the ideal. The theoretical state of perfect compromise. Doesn’t exist in real life.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” Emily said. “I see.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tell them to say what they mean,” Sashona said, returning to her work. “Probably someone new.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She did her best to write a meaningful report about the oddly flat graph and dutifully submitted it to the ticket system. Another ticket was waiting, but she felt distracted, and gazed at passing clouds instead. She had the feeling something was going to happen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Six minutes later, the power went out. She rolled her chair back from her dead monitor. Heads poked up from cubicles. “I thought we had a backup generator,” said Sashona. Her voice sounded loud. Emily hadn’t noticed the hum of the air-conditioning until it was gone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">An alarm began to jangle. People’s voices rose. Rosenberg speculated about fire in Labs, which would be a problem, because a lot of those doors were time-locked. They made for the stairwells but Emily didn’t follow. Sashona hung in the doorway. “Woolf?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head. She was feeling stupid. She had waited too long. She should have walked out of this building six minutes ago. She should have done it the moment she saw that graph.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Woolf! It’s not optional. Time to go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She ran through floor plans in her head. There was no fire escape. She hadn’t realized that before. No glass cases saying <span class="SCAP1">IN CASE OF EMERGENCY</span>. No one had ever gathered them in a conference room and explained where to go in an orderly fashion in the event that they needed to evacuate.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sashona gave up on her and disappeared. Emily could go up or down. Those were her only options. She reached the stairwell and started climbing. She heard disembodied voices rising around her like departed spirits. A door boomed and there was silence but for her own breathing. She didn’t hear anyone else going down, she realized: no one from other floors. She stopped to kick off her shoes, which were helping no one. She climbed and climbed and finally saw daylight. She even jogged up the last few steps but found herself at a scuffed steel door that was chained and padlocked. She tried it anyway. She sat on the concrete and tried to figure out what next.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Somewhere far below, a door clacked open, then slammed. This happened eight or nine times. She listened but couldn’t hear anything more. “Fuck,” she said. She was pissed at herself. She had spent too long in Broken Hill, not needing an escape route. She balled her hands into fists. <em class="calibre1">Think.</em> There was a skylight. It was secured, but how well? She went back to the door and put one foot into a loop of chain and pulled herself up, searching for fingerholds. Balancing, she reached for the skylight, but it was too far away. She heard a rasping. What the fuck that was, she did not know, but it was coming from below and getting closer. She managed to inch her way up until she was standing on the bar of the door. The chain swung and clanked like a bell. Like she was deliberately trying to attract attention. Her fingertips brushed the skylight but that was the best she could do. If she released her grip on the door frame, she could possibly grab this thing and pull it out of the ceiling as she fell. There was a very slim chance of that happening. She heard footsteps. Boots on concrete. The rasping punctuated the air at regular intervals, like breathing but not. She should have learned words. She should not have waited for someone to teach her. She should have found them somehow. She leaped at the skylight and her fingers skidded uselessly over the plastic and she fell to the concrete and banged her knee. “<em class="calibre1">Suck</em>,” she said. A man came up the stairs. A kind of man. He was wearing black from head to toe and his eyes were black, bulky goggles, like night vision gear, set into a fighter pilot’s helmet, with bulging plastic hemispheres over the ears. He looked like he could walk through fire. The rasping was his air regulator.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Shakaf veeha mannigh danoe!</em>” she said. This was a mess of attention words for random segments. The chances of it having any effect were about a thousand to one. “Lie down!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He extended a gloved hand. “Come with me.” These words came out flat and computer-modulated. She didn’t move. If he came closer, she could jump him. She didn’t see a gun. She would go for those goggles. If she could even dislodge them, it would make it hard for him to chase her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hurry.” The man gestured to the stairs. “There’s a fire.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There isn’t,” she said. “Is there.” He didn’t answer. She’d figured out by now that he couldn’t hear her. She began to walk down the steps.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The lobby had been converted to a makeshift hospital, full of white cloth screens. The windows were blacked out with plastic sheeting. Black-suited spacemen moved between them, respirators hissing. She saw no one’s face she didn’t know from level five. She glimpsed Sashona on a trolley bed but then lost her behind a screen. She was told to stay where she was. Nobody spoke to her. Or to each other, at least that she could hear. An hour later, a spaceman drew back her curtain. He wasn’t wearing his helmet and she was surprised at his youth. He had a mustache, thin and fluffy. She wondered if this was the guy who had fetched her from the top of the stairs. If so, she should have gone with <em class="calibre1">narratak</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can go.” He began to disassemble screens.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What was all that about?” But she wasn’t really expecting an answer. Outside, she found the others huddled on the street. It was dusk, the tail end of rush hour.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A drill,” said Sashona. “But for what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No point wondering,” said Raine. “We’ll never know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“True, that,” said Sashona. She was wondering why Emily hadn’t come downstairs with them. And, by extension, what Emily knew that she didn’t.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily couldn’t hang around any longer. She started walking and by the time she reached the subway, she was shaking. She would not do anything rash. She would come to work in the morning, go to her desk, and do her job, like always. But this had been a lesson. A reminder. The next time something like this happened, she told herself, she would have a way out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She kept a notepad and wrote down syllables she noticed were used more frequently by one psychographic than another. On the train, she listened for deviations from the average. She picked apart the words she knew, looking for patterns. She was surprised at how obvious they were. Liberals overused -<em class="calibre1">ay</em> and <em class="calibre1">-ee</em>, the front vowel sounds. Authoritarians were thick with fricatives. She developed hunches from newspapers and TV and websites, tracked down a suitable representative, at a bar or church meeting or the grocery store, and tried trotting them out. Like a safecracker listening for tumblers. <em class="calibre1">Sut. Stut. Stuh.</em> She slid guesses into sentences and usually people didn’t even seem to register them. They didn’t make it past the perceptual filter, ignored as verbal static. At worst, they thought she was stuttering. Her hunches were usually wrong. But sometimes she saw a flinch. A tiny flare across the muscles of the face. And that was a tumbler.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was a hard way to learn words. She could do this for a year and still know less than Sashona. But it was very thorough. It forced her to understand the underlying principles. She deduced a preference for alliteration in a segment from what she knew of the segments around it, leaping from there to <em class="calibre1">lallito</em>, a command word, and this thrilled her more than anything she had been taught. Because she had found it herself.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once, sharing drinks at the corner bar, Sashona confided that she had trouble with segment 191. “I get <em class="calibre1">kavakifa</em>,” said Sashona, leaning forward, holding her wineglass at an angle that Emily was tempted to correct. “I can get to <em class="calibre1">fedoriant</em>. But then I’m lost!” She gestured expansively. “I can <em class="calibre1">never remember</em>.” This was part of a tale concerning a high-speed joyride down the I-48, a police officer on a motorbike, and a speeding ticket Sashona had hilariously failed to talk her way out of. But Emily was astounded. Apparently Sashona couldn’t see that the words of segment 191 were bound together. She could understand if Sashona had forgotten the entire tree. But if you knew one, you had half of the others. Sashona did not seem to get this. She had memorized them one at a time, as if they were unconnected. Like a tray of random objects in a child’s puzzle game.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">One thing Emily never got over was the feeling of being watched. She wasn’t sure how, but it was happening. She tried varying her route to work, checking reflections, doubling back unexpectedly, but never saw anyone. At home, she double-bolted, but felt no safer. Her feeling was that Yeats was in the apartment. That was her impression. One night, she dreamed he came into her bedroom like a black wind and leaned over her, watching her without emotion, as if she were a thing beneath glass.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">On the first Tuesday of her sixth month in Washington, she left her apartment and walked to the local train station. She rode escalators down to the platform and waited for the red line. It was warm; she was thinking about getting to her desk and taking off her shoes. A man at the end of the platform had a guitar and was banging out a song she loathed, for personal reasons: “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” The train began to pull in. In its passing windows she glimpsed Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For a moment she wasn’t sure whether she had seen him inside the train or reflected behind her. Then the train ground to a halt and the doors opened and he said from behind her: “Let it go.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She watched the train pull out. She was sixteen years old again. Just like that. But then she turned and he wasn’t so frightening. He had aged around the eyes. He was just a man, after all.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you in love?” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She didn’t answer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t lie to me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry,” she said. “I’ll stop.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Your next mistake will end you. This is as far as I can go to protect you. You need to appreciate this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I do. I promise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyes searched her. “No more calls. Not one.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m done. I’m done, Eliot.” In this moment, she really meant it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He walked away. She stood on the empty platform.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She did not call Harry that night. The following day, she did not call him. She had gone longer than this without hearing his voice but now it was different, because it was the end. She felt sick. She couldn’t taste anything. It was crazy but she could no longer taste food. At work, she clicked through tickets and wrote reports but couldn’t tell if they made any sense. When it got too much, she went to the bathroom and put her head between her knees. She made herself repeat: <em class="calibre1">Do not call him.</em> She felt possessed, by a cruel, heartless Emily who did not love.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She surrendered on the third day. It was a terrible betrayal of Eliot; she realized that. He had stuck his neck out for her in ways she couldn’t quite comprehend and she had promised to stop. But the fact was she couldn’t. She had tried but she couldn’t. It had been six months and home was still on the other side of the world.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She couldn’t call Harry again. Eliot would know, or, worse, others would. There was no stay-but-keep-calling-him option. She could only leave.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Years before, in San Francisco, Emily and a girlfriend had been crossing a McDonald’s parking lot and found themselves boxed in by a group of barely pubescent boys with low pants and twitchy smiles. One of the boys had a gun, which he kept putting away and getting out again, swapping from hand to hand, and the others began to ask Emily and her friend if they knew what hot bitches they were and how badly they were about to get fucked up. This was a bad situation even without the gun, but Emily had been young and stupid, so she walked up to the boy with the gun and pulled it right out of his hands. She had good fingers, even then, because of the card tricks. She didn’t know a thing about guns, except which end to hold, but that was enough, so the boys stood around looking scared while Emily and her friend made a lot of silly threats and walked out backward.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The lesson here was probably that she should not cross parking lots in bad neighborhoods. But also, when you were outmuscled, if there was a gun around, you could get control of the situation by getting the gun.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily was outmuscled. She did not have a gun. But she suspected there was one in the basement.</p>
