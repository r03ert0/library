      <h2>Miller shook his head, a sad but distant expression on his...</h2>
      <p>â€œHe took high-caliber round to the center of mass,â€� Miller said. â€œHeâ€™s gone.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œFuck me,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou keep saying that.â€�</p>
      <p>A bright neon sign flashed above the corridor that led out of the casino levels and onto the ramps down to the docks. THANK YOU FOR PLAYING, it read. AnFOR Psinead. And YOUâ€™RE ALWAYS A WINNER ON EROS. Below it, two ranks of men in heavy combat armor blocked the way. They might have given up on crowd control in the casinos, but they werenâ€™t letting anyone go.</p>
      <p>Holden and Miller crouched behind an overturned coffee cart a hundred meters from the soldiers. As they watched, a dozen or so people made a dash toward the guards and were summarily mowed down by machine gun fire, then fell to the deck beside those who had tried before.</p>
      <p>â€œI count thirty-four of them,â€� Miller said. â€œHow many can you handle?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden spun to look at him in surprise, but Millerâ€™s face told him the former cop was joking.</p>
      <p>â€œKidding aside, how do we get past that?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œThirty men with machine guns and a clear line of sight. No cover to speak of for the last twenty meters or so,â€� Miller said. â€œWe donâ€™t get past that.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Thirty: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>They sat on the floor with their backs to a bank of pachinko machines no one was playing, watching the ebb and flow of the violence around them like it was a soccer game. Millerâ€™s hat was perched on his bent knee. He felt the vibration against his back when one of the displays cycled through its dupe-call. The lights glittered and glowed. Holden, beside him, was breathing hard, like heâ€™d run a race. Out beyond them, like something from Hieronymous Bosch, the casino levels of Eros prepared for death.</p>
      <p>The riotâ€™s momentum had spent itself for now. Men and women gathered together in small groups. Guards strode through, threatening and scattering any bunch that got too large or unruly. Something was burning fast enough that the air scrubbers couldnâ€™t get out the smell of melting plastic. The bhangra Muzak mixed with weeping and screaming and wails of despair. Some idiot was shouting at one of the so-called cops: he was a lawyer; he was getting all of this on video; whoever was responsible was going to be in big trouble. Miller watched a bunch of people start to gather around the confrontation. The guy in the riot gear listened, nodded, and shot the lawyer once in the kneecap. The crowd dispersed except for one woman, the lawyerâ€™s wife or girlfriend, bent down over him screaming. And in the privacy of Millerâ€™s skull, everything slowly fell apart.</p>
      <p>He was aware of having two different minds. One was the Miller he was used to, familiar with. The one who was thinking about what was going to happen when he got out, what the next step would be in connecting the dots between Phoebe Station, Ceres, Eros, and Juliette Mao, how to work the case. That version of him was scanning the crowd the way he might have watched the line at a crime scene, waiting for some detail, some change to catch his attention. Send him in the right direction to solve the mystery. It was the shortsighted, idiotic part of him that couldnâ€™t conceive of his own personal extinction, and it thought surely, surely there was going to be an after.</p>
      <p>The other Miller was different. Quieter. Sad, maybe, but at peace. Heâ€™d read a poem many years before called â€œThe Death-Self,â€� and he hadnâ€™t understood the term until now. A knot at the middle of his psyche was untying. All the energy heâ€™d put into holding things togetherâ€”Ceres, his marriage, his career, himselfâ€”was coming free. Heâ€™d shot and killed more men in the past day than in his whole career as a cop. Heâ€™d startedâ€”only startedâ€”to realize that only tog…heâ€™d actually fallen in love with the object of his search after he knew for certain that heâ€™d lost her. Heâ€™d seen unequivocally that the chaos heâ€™d dedicated his life to holding at bay was stronger and wider and more powerful than he would ever be. No compromise he could make would be enough. His death-self was unfolding in him, and the dark blooming took no effort. It was a relief, a relaxation, a long, slow exhale after decades of holding it in.</p>
      <p>He was in ruins, but it was okay, because he was dying.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Holden said. His voice was stronger than Miller had expected it might be.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDid you ever watch Misko and Marisko when you were a kid?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller frowned. â€œThe kidsâ€™ show?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œThe one with the five dinosaurs and the evil guy in the big pink hat,â€� Holden said, then starting humming a bright, boppy tune. Miller closed his eyes and then started singing along. The music had had words once. Now it was only a series of rises and falls, runs up and down a major scale, with every dissonance resolved in the note that followed.</p>
      <p>â€œGuess I must have,â€� Miller said when they reached the end.</p>
      <p>â€œI loved that show. I must have been eight or nine last time I saw it,â€� Holden said. â€œFunny how that stuff stays with you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. He coughed, turned his head, and spat out something red. â€œHow are you holding together?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI think Iâ€™m okay,â€� Holden said. Then, a moment later, he added, â€œAs long as I donâ€™t stand up.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNauseated?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, some.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMe too.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat is this?â€� Holden asked. â€œI mean, what the hell is this all about? Why are they doing this?â€�</p>
      <p>It was a fair question. Slaughtering Erosâ€”slaughtering any station in the Beltâ€”was a pretty easy job. Anyone with first-year orbital mechanics skills could find a way to sling a rock big enough and fast enough to crack the station open. With the effort Protogen had put in, they could have killed the air supply or drugged it or whatever the hell they wanted to do. This wasnâ€™t a murder. This wasnâ€™t even a genocide.</p>
      <p>And then there was all the observation equipment. Cameras, communications arrays, air and water sensors. There were only two reasons for that kind of shit. Either the mad bastards at Protogen got off on watching people die, orâ€¦</p>
      <p>â€œThey donâ€™t know,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>He turned to look at Holden. The first Miller, the detective, the optimist, the one who needed to know, was driving now. His death-self didnâ€™t fight, because of course it didnâ€™t. It didnâ€™t fight anything. Miller raised his hand, like he was giving a lecture to a rookie.</p>
      <p>â€œThey donâ€™t know what itâ€™s about, orâ€¦ you know, at least they donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going to happen. This isnâ€™t even built like a torture chamber. Itâ€™s all being watched, right? Water and air sensors. Itâ€™s a petri dish. They donâ€™t know what that shit that killed Julie does, and this is how theyâ€™re finding out.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden frowned.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t they have laboratories? Places where you could moriestorcould maybe put that crap on some animals or something? Because as experimental design goes, this seems a little messed up.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe they need a really big sample size,â€� Miller said. â€œOr maybe itâ€™s not about the people. Maybe itâ€™s about what happens to the station.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s a cheery thought,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>The Julie Mao in Millerâ€™s mind brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes. She was frowning, looking thoughtful, interested, concerned. It all had to make sense. It was like one of those basic orbital mechanics problems where every hitch and veer seemed random until all the variables slipped into place. What had been inexplicable became inevitable. Julie smiled at him. Julie as she had been. As he imagined she had been. The Miller who hadnâ€™t resigned himself to death smiled back. And then she was gone, his mind shifting to the noise from the pachinko machines and the low, demonic wailing of the crowds.</p>
      <p>Another groupâ€”twenty men hunkered low, like linebackersâ€”made a rush toward the mercenaries guarding the opening to the port. The gunmen mowed them down.</p>
      <p>â€œIf we had enough people,â€� Holden said after the sound of machine guns fell away, â€œwe could make it. They couldnâ€™t kill all of us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s what the patrol goons are for,â€� Miller said. â€œMake sure no one can organize a big enough push. Keep stirring the pot.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBut if it was a mob, I mean a really big mob, it couldâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe,â€� Miller agreed. Something in his chest clicked in a way it hadnâ€™t a minute before. He took a slow, deep breath, and the click happened again. He could feel it deep in his left lung.</p>
      <p>â€œAt least Naomi got away,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œThat is good.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™s amazing. Sheâ€™d never put Amos and Alex in danger if she could help it. I mean, sheâ€™s serious. Professional. Strong, you know? I mean, sheâ€™s really, reallyâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPretty, too,â€� Miller said. â€œGreat hair. Love the eyes.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, that wasnâ€™t what I meant,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t think sheâ€™s a good-looking woman?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™s my XO,â€� Holden said. â€œSheâ€™sâ€¦ you knowâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOff-limits.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden sighed.</p>
      <p>â€œShe got away, didnâ€™t she?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œAlmost for sure.â€�</p>
      <p>They were silent. One of the linebackers coughed, stood up, and limped back into the casino, trailing blood from a hole in his ribs. The bhangra gave way to an afropop medley with a low, sultry voice singing in languages Miller didnâ€™t know.</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™d wait for us,â€� Holden said. â€œDonâ€™t you think sheâ€™d wait for us?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAlmost for sure,â€� Millerâ€™s death-self said, not particularly caring if it was a lie. He thought about it for a long moment, then turned to face Holden again. â€œHey. Just so you know it? Iâ€™m not exactly at my best right now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAll right.â€�</p>
      <p>The glowing orange lockdown lights on the tube station across the level clicked to green. Miller sat forward, intereste. Mil â€terested. His back felt sticky, but it was probably just sweat. Other people had noticed the change too. Like a current in a water tank, the attention of the nearby crowds shifted from the mercenaries blocking the way to the port to the brushed-steel doors of the tube station.</p>
      <p>The doors opened, and the first zombies appeared. Men and women, their eyes glassy and their muscles slack, stumbled out through the open doors. Miller had seen a documentary feed about hemorrhagic fevers as part of his training on Ceres Station. Their movements were the same: listless, driven, autonomic. Like rabid dogs whose minds had already been given over to their disease.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Miller said, his hand on Holdenâ€™s shoulder. â€œHey, itâ€™s happening.â€�</p>
      <p>An older man in a pair of emergency services scrubs approached the shambling newcomers. His hands were out before him, as if he could corral them by simple force of will. The first zombie in the pack turned empty eyes toward him and vomited up a spray of very familiar brown goo.</p>
      <p>â€œLook,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œI saw.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, look!â€�</p>
      <p>All down the casino level, tube station lights were going off lockdown. Doors were opening. The people were pulsing toward the open tubes and the implicit, empty promise of escape, and away from the dead men and women walking out from them.</p>
      <p>â€œVomit zombies,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œFrom the rad shelters,â€� Holden said. â€œThe thing, the organism. It goes faster in radiation, right? Thatâ€™s why whatâ€™s-her-name was so freaky about the lights and the vac suit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHer nameâ€™s Julie. And yeah. Those incubators were for this. Right here,â€� Miller said, and sighed. He thought about standing up. â€œWell. We may not die of radiation poisoning after all.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy not just pump that shit into the air?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œAnaerobic, remember?â€� Miller said. â€œToo much oxygen kills â€™em.â€�</p>
      <p>The vomit-covered emergency medicine guy was still trying to treat the shambling zombies like they were patients. Like they were still humans. There were smears of the brown goo on peopleâ€™s clothes, on the walls. The tube doors opened again, and Miller saw half a dozen people dodge into a tube car coated in brown. The mob churned, unsure what to do, the group mind stretched past its breaking point.</p>
      <p>A riot cop jumped forward and started spraying down the zombies with gunfire. The entrance and exit wounds spilled out fine loops of black filament, and the zombies went down. Miller chuckled even before he knew what was funny. Holden looked at him.</p>
      <p>â€œThey didnâ€™t know,â€� Miller said. â€œThe bully boys in riot gear? They arenâ€™t gonna get pulled out. Meat for the machine, just like the rest of us.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden made a small approving sound. Miller nodded, but something was niggling at the back of his mind. The thugs from Ceres in their stolen armor were being sacrificed. That didnâ€™t mean everyone was. He leaned forward.</p>
      <p>The archway leading to the port was still manned. Mercenary fighters in formation, guns at the ready. If anything, they looked more disciplined now than they had before. Miller watched as the guy in the back with extra insignia on his armor barked into a mic.</p>
      <p>Miller had thought hope was dead. Heâ€™d thought all his chances had been playedall he p played, and then, like a bitch, it all hauled itself up out of the grave.</p>
      <p>â€œGet up,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGet up. Theyâ€™re going to pull back.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWho?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded at the mercenaries.</p>
      <p>â€œThey knew,â€� he said. â€œLook at them. They arenâ€™t freaking out. They arenâ€™t confused. They were waiting for this.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd you think that means theyâ€™ll fall back?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey arenâ€™t going to be hanging out. Stand up.â€�</p>
      <p>Almost as if heâ€™d been giving the order to himself, Miller groaned and creaked to his feet. His knees and spine ached badly. The click in his lung was getting worse. His belly made a soft, complicated noise that would have been concerning under different circumstances. As soon as he started moving, he could feel how far the damage had gone, his skin not yet in pain but in the soft presentiment of it, like the gap between a serious burn and the blisters that followed. If he lived, it was going to hurt.</p>
      <p>If he lived, everything was going to hurt.</p>
      <p>His death-self tugged at him. The sense of release, of relief, of rest felt like something precious being lost. Even while the chattering, busy, machinelike mind kept grinding, grinding, grinding forward, the soft, bruised center of Millerâ€™s soul urged him to pause, sit back down, let the problems go away.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat are we looking for?â€� Holden said. Heâ€™d stood up. A blood vessel in the manâ€™s left eye had given way, the white of the sclera turning a bright, meaty red.</p>
      <p>What are we looking for? the death-self echoed.</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™re going to fall back,â€� Miller said, answering the first question. â€œWe follow. Just outside the range so whoeverâ€™s going last doesnâ€™t feel like he has to shoot us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIsnâ€™t everyone going to do the same thing? I mean, once theyâ€™re gone, isnâ€™t everyone in this place going to head in for the port?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI expect so,â€� Miller said. â€œSo letâ€™s try to slip in ahead of the rush. Look. There.â€�</p>
      <p>It wasnâ€™t much. Just a change in the mercenariesâ€™ stance, a shift in their collective center of gravity. Miller coughed. It hurt more than it should have.</p>
      <p>What are we looking for? his death-self asked again, its voice more insistent. An answer? Justice? Another chance for the universe to kick us in the balls? What is through that archway that there isnâ€™t a faster, cleaner, less painful version of in the barrel of our gun?</p>
      <p>The mercenary captain took a casual step back and strode down the exterior corridor and out of sight. Where he had been, Julie Mao sat, watching him go. She looked at Miller. She waved him on.</p>
      <p>â€œNot yet,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhen?â€� Holden said, his voice surprising Miller. Julie in his head flickered out, and he was back in the real world.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s coming,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>He should warn the guy. It was only fair. You got into a bad place, and at the very least, you owed your partner the courtesy of letting him know. Miller cleared his throat. That hurt too.</p>
