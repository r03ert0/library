			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-First">The British National Party has compiled personal details of tens of thousands of voters, it was revealed on Friday.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The database, named Electrac, is used to personalize pamphlet, door-to-door, and telephone campaigns.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">Mark Mitchell, 38, claimed he worked for the BNP for eight months on the project, gathering information from sources including surveys, letters to the editor, online posts, and attendance at events.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">He said it allowed voters to be segmented into different groups, with each group receiving targeted material during the lead-up to the general election.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-Last">A spokesperson for the BNP acknowledged the use of Electrac but said the practice was widespread amongst political organizations and no privacy laws were breached.</p>
