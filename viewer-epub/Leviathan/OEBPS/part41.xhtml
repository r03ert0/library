      <h2>â€œIâ€™ve killed people before, you know. But they were...</h2>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not the same, is it?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œNo, it isnâ€™t,â€� Holden replied. â€œDoes this go away?â€�</p>
      <p>Sometimes, Miller thought.</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� he said. â€œNot if youâ€™ve still got a soul.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay. Thanks.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOne other thing?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI know itâ€™s none of my business, but I really wouldnâ€™t let her put you off. So you donâ€™t understand sex and love and women. Just means you were born with a cock. And this girl? Naomi? She seems like sheâ€™s worth putting a little effort into it. You know?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Holden said. Then: â€œCan we never talk about that again?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure.â€�</p>
      <p>The ship creaked and gravity shifted a degree to Millerâ€™s right. Course correction. Nothing interesting. Miller closed his eyes and tried to will himself to sleep. His mind was full of dead men and Julie and love and sex. There was something Holden had said about the war that was important, but he couldnâ€™t make the pieces fit. They kept changing. Miller sighed, shifted his weight so that he blocked one of his drainage tubes and had to shift back to stop the alarm.</p>
      <p>When the blood pressure cuff fired off again, it was Julie holding him, pulling herself so close her lips brushed his ear. His eyes opened, his mind seeing both the imaginary girl and the monitors that she would have blocked if sheâ€™d really been there.</p>
      <p>I love you too, she said, and I will take care of you.</p>
      <p>He smiled at seeing the numbers change as his heart raced.</p>
      <p>Chapter Thirty-Tnt si sl…hree: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>For five more days, Holden and Miller lay on their backs in sick bay while the solar system burned down around them. The reports of Erosâ€™ death ran from massive ecological collapse brought about by war-related supply shortages, to covert Martian attack, to secret Belt bioweapon laboratory accident. Analysis from the inner planets had it that the OPA and terrorists like them had finally shown how dangerous they could be to innocent civilian populations. The Belt blamed Mars, or the maintenance crews of Eros, or the OPA for not stopping it.</p>
      <p>And then a group of Martian frigates blockaded Pallas, a revolt on Ganymede ended in sixteen dead, and the new government of Ceres announced that all ships with Martian registry docked on station were being commandeered. The threats and accusations, all set to the constant human background noise of war drums, moved on. Eros had been a tragedy and a crime, but it was finished, and there were new dangers popping up in every corner of human space.</p>
      <p>Holden turned off his newsfeed, fidgeted in his bunk, and tried to wake Miller up by staring at him. It didnâ€™t work. The massive radiation exposure had failed to give him superpowers. Miller began to snore.</p>
      <p>Holden sat up, testing the gravity. Less than a quarter g. Alex wasnâ€™t in a hurry, then. Naomi was giving him and Miller time to heal before they arrived at Julieâ€™s magical mystery asteroid.</p>
      <p>Shit.</p>
      <p>Naomi.</p>
      <p>The last few times sheâ€™d come into sick bay had been awkward. She never brought the subject of his failed romantic gesture back up, but he could feel a barrier between them now that filled him with regret. And every time she left the room, Miller would look away from him and sigh, which just made it worse.</p>
      <p>But he couldnâ€™t avoid her forever, no matter how much he felt like an idiot. He swung his feet off the edge of the bed and pressed down on the floor. His legs felt weak but not rubbery. The soles of his feet hurt, but quite a bit less than nearly everything else on his body. He stood up, one hand still on the bed, and tested his balance. He wobbled but remained upright. Two steps reassured him that walking was possible in the light gravity. The IV tugged at his arm. He was down to just one bag of something a faint blue. He had no idea what it was, but after Naomiâ€™s description of how close to death heâ€™d come, he figured it must be important. He pulled it off the wall hook and held it in his left hand. The room smelled like antiseptic and diarrhea. He was happy to be leaving.</p>
      <p>â€œWhere you going?â€� Miller asked, his voice groggy.</p>
      <p>â€œOut.â€� Holden had the sudden, visceral memory of being fifteen.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Miller said, then rolled onto his side.</p>
      <p>The sick bay hatch was four meters from the central ladder, and Holden covered the ground with a slow, careful shuffle, his paper booties making a whispery scuffing sound on the fabric-covered metal floor. The ladder itself defeated him. Even though ops was only one deck up, the three-meter climb might as well have been a thousand. He pressed the button to call the lift, and a few seconds later, the floor hatch slid open and the lift climbed through with an electric whine. Holden tried to hop on but managed only a sort of slow-motion fall that ended with his clutching the ladder and kneeling on the lift platform. He stopped the lift, pulled himself upright, and started it again, then rode it up to the next deck in rodic  deck in what he hoped was a less beaten and more captain-like pose.</p>
      <p>â€œJesus, Captain, you still look like shit,â€� Amos said as the lift came to a stop. The mechanic was sprawled across two chairs at the sensor stations and munching on what looked like a strip of leather.</p>
      <p>â€œYou keep saying that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œKeeps beinâ€™ true.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAmos, donâ€™t you have work to do?â€� Naomi said. She was sitting at one of the computer stations, watching something flash by on the screen. She didnâ€™t look up when Holden came onto the deck. That was a bad sign.</p>
      <p>â€œNope. Most boring ship I ever worked, Boss. She donâ€™t break, she donâ€™t leak, she donâ€™t even have an annoying rattle to tighten down,â€� Amos replied as he sucked down the last of his snack and smacked his lips.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s always mopping,â€� Naomi said, then tapped out something on the screen in front of her. Amos looked from her to Holden and back again.</p>
      <p>â€œOh, that reminds me. I better get down to the engine room and look at thatâ€¦ thing Iâ€™ve been meaning to look at,â€� Amos said, and jumped to his feet. â€œâ€™Scuse me, Cap.â€�</p>
      <p>He squeezed past Holden, hopped on the lift, and rode it sternward. The deck hatch closed behind him.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Holden said to Naomi once Amos was gone.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� she said without turning around. That wasnâ€™t good either. When sheâ€™d sent Amos away, heâ€™d hoped she wanted to talk. It didnâ€™t look like it. Holden sighed and shuffled over to the chair next to her. He collapsed into it, his legs tingling like heâ€™d run a kilometer instead of just walking twenty-odd steps. Naomi had left her hair down, and it hid her face from him. Holden wanted to brush it back but was afraid sheâ€™d snap his elbow with Belter kung fu if he tried.</p>
      <p>â€œLook, Naomi,â€� he started, but she ignored him and hit a button on her panel. He stopped when Fredâ€™s face appeared on the display in front of her.</p>
      <p>â€œIs that Fred?â€� he said, because he couldnâ€™t think of anything even more idiotic to say.</p>
      <p>â€œYou should see this. Got it from Tycho a couple hours ago on the tightbeam after I sent them an update on our status.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi tapped the play button and Fredâ€™s face sprang to life.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi, sounds like you guys have had a tough time of it. The airâ€™s full of chatter on the station shutdown, and the supposed nuclear explosion. No one knows what to make of it. Keep us informed. In the meantime, we managed to hack open that data cube you left here. I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll help much, though. Looks like a bunch of sensor data from the Donnager, mostly EM stuff. Weâ€™ve tried looking for hidden messages, but my smartest people canâ€™t find anything. Iâ€™m passing the data along to you. Let me know if you find anything. Tycho out.â€�</p>
      <p>The screen went blank.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat does the data look like?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s just what the man said,â€� Naomi said. â€œEM sensor data from the Donnager during the pursuit by the six ships, and the battle itself. Iâ€™ve dug through raw stuff, looking for anything hidden inside, but for the life of me, I canâ€™t find a thing. Iâ€™ve even had the Roci digging through the data for the last couple hours, looking for patterns. She has really good software for that sort of thing. But so far, hat sr oo far, nothing.â€�</p>
      <p>She tapped on the screen again and the raw data began spooling past faster than Holden could follow. In a small window inside the larger screen, the Rocinanteâ€™s pattern-recognition software worked to find meaning. Holden watched it for a minute, but his eyes quickly unfocused.</p>
      <p>â€œLieutenant Kelly died for this data,â€� he said. â€œHe left the ship while his mates were still fighting. Marines donâ€™t do that unless it matters.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi shrugged and pointed at the screen with resignation.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s what was on his cube,â€� she said. â€œMaybe thereâ€™s something steganographic, but I donâ€™t have another dataset to compare it to.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden began tapping on his thigh, his pain and romantic failures momentarily forgotten.</p>
      <p>â€œSo letâ€™s say that this data is all that it is. Thereâ€™s nothing hidden. What would this information mean to the Martian navy?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes in thought, one finger twisting and untwisting a curl of hair by her temple.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s mostly EM data, so lots of engine-signature stuff. Drive radiation is the best way to keep track of other ships. So that tells you where which ships were during the fight. Tactical data?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe,â€� Holden said. â€œWould that be important enough to send Kelly out with?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi took a deep breath and let it out slowly.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t think so,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œMe either.â€�</p>
      <p>Something tapped at the edge of his conscious mind, asking to be let in.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat was that thing with Amos all about?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œAmos?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHim showing up at the airlock with two guns when we arrived,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œThere was some trouble on our trip back to the ship.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTrouble for who?â€� Holden asked. Naomi actually smiled at that.</p>
      <p>â€œSome bad men didnâ€™t want us to hack the lockdown on the Roci. Amos talked it over with them. You didnâ€™t think it was because we were waiting for you, did you, sir?â€�</p>
      <p>Was there a smile in her voice? A hint of coyness? Flirtation? He stopped himself from grinning.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat did the Roci say about the data when you ran it?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œHere,â€� Naomi replied, and hit something on her panel. The screen began displaying long lists of data in text. â€œLots of EM and light spectrum stuff, some leakage from damagedâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>Holden yelped. Naomi looked up at him.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m such an idiot,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œGranted. Elaborate?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden touched the screen and began scrolling up and down through the data. He tapped one long list of numbers and letters and leaned back with a grin.</p>
      <p>â€œThere, thatâ€™s it,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s what?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHull structure isnâ€™t the only recognition metric. Itâ€™s the most accurate, but itâ€™s also got the shortest range an alsong.ange andâ€�â€”he gestured around him at the Rocinanteâ€”â€œis the easiest to fool. The next best method is drive signature. Canâ€™t mask your radiation and heat patterns. And theyâ€™re easy to spot even from really far away.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden turned on the screen next to his chair and pulled up the shipâ€™s friend/foe database, then linked it to the data on Naomiâ€™s screen.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s what this message is, Naomi. Itâ€™s telling Mars who killed the Donnager by showing them what the drive signature was.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThen why not just say, â€˜So-and-so killed us,â€™ in a nice easy-to-read text file?â€� Naomi asked, a skeptical frown on her face.</p>
      <p>Holden leaned forward and paused, opened his mouth, then closed it and sat back again with a sigh.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know.â€�</p>
      <p>A hatch banged open with a hydraulic whine; then Naomi looked past Holden to the ladder and said, â€œMillerâ€™s coming up.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden turned to watch the detective finish the slow climb up from the sick bay deck. He looked like a plucked chicken, pink-gray skin stippled with gooseflesh. His paper gown went poorly with the hat.</p>
      <p>â€œUh, thereâ€™s a lift,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œWish Iâ€™d known that,â€� Miller replied, then dragged himself up onto the ops deck with a gasp. â€œWe there yet?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTrying to figure out a mystery,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œI hate mysteries,â€� Miller said, then hauled himself to his feet and made his way to a chair.</p>
      <p>â€œThen solve this one for us. You find out who murdered someone. You canâ€™t arrest them yourself, so you send the information to your partner. But instead of just sending the perpâ€™s name, you send your partner all the clues. Why?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller coughed and scratched his chin. His eyes were fixed on something, like he was reading a screen Holden couldnâ€™t see.</p>
      <p>â€œBecause I donâ€™t trust myself. I want my partner to arrive at the same conclusion I did, without my biasing him. I give him the dots, see what it looks like when he connects â€™em.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEspecially if guessing wrong has consequences,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t like to screw up a murder charge,â€� Miller said with a nod. â€œLooks unprofessional.â€�</p>
      <p>Holdenâ€™s panel beeped at him.</p>
      <p>â€œShit, I know why they were careful,â€� he said after reading his screen. â€œThe Roci thinks those were standard light-cruiser engines built by the Bush Shipyards.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey were Earth ships?â€� Naomi said. â€œBut they werenâ€™t flying any colors, andâ€¦ Son of a bitch!â€�</p>
      <p>It was the first time Holden had ever heard her yell, and he understood. If UNN black ops ships had killed the Donnager, then that meant Earth was behind the whole thing. Maybe even killing the Canterbury in the first place. It would mean that Martian warships were killing Belters for no reason. Belters like Naomi.</p>
      <p>Holden leaned forward and called up the comm display, then tapped out a general broadcast. Miller caught his breath.</p>
      <p>â€œThat button you just pressed doesnâ€™t do what I think it does, does it?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œI finished Kellyâ€™s mission fœI fi="0ssion for him,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œI have no idea who the fuck Kelly is,â€� Miller said, â€œbut please tell me that his mission wasnâ€™t broadcasting that data to the solar system at large.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPeople need to know whatâ€™s going on,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œYes, they do, but maybe we should actually know what the hell is going on before we tell them,â€� Miller replied, all the weariness gone from his voice. â€œHow gullible are you?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Holden said, but Miller got louder.</p>
      <p>â€œYou found a Martian battery, right? So you told everyone in the solar system about it and started the single largest war in human history. Only turns out the Martians maybe werenâ€™t the ones that left it there. Then, a bunch of mystery ships kill the Donnager, which Mars blames on the Belt, only, dammit, the Belt didnâ€™t even know it was capable of killing a Martian battle cruiser.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden opened his mouth, but Miller grabbed a bulb of coffee Amos had left behind on the console and threw it at his head.</p>
      <p>â€œLet me finish! And now you find some data that implicates Earth. First thing you do is blab it to the universe, so that Mars and the Belt drag Earth into this thing, making the largest war of all time even bigger. Are you seeing a pattern here?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œSo what do you thinkâ€™s going to happen?â€� Miller said. â€œThis is how these people work! They made the Canterbury look like Mars. It wasnâ€™t. They made the Donnager look like the Belt. It wasnâ€™t. Now it looks like the whole damn thingâ€™s Earth? Follow the pattern. It probably isnâ€™t! You never, never put that kind of accusation out there until you know the score. You look. You listen. Youâ€™re quiet, fercrissakes, and when you know, then you can make your case.â€�</p>
      <p>The detective sat back, clearly exhausted. He was sweating. The deck was silent.</p>
      <p>â€œYou done?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Miller nodded, breathing heavily. â€œThink I might have strained something.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI havenâ€™t accused anyone of doing anything,â€� Holden said. â€œIâ€™m not building a case. I just put the data out there. Now itâ€™s not a secret. Theyâ€™re doing something on Eros. They donâ€™t want it interrupted. With Mars and the Belt shooting at each other, everyone with the resources to help is busy elsewhere.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd you just dragged Earth into it,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe,â€� Holden said. â€œBut the killers did use ships that were built, at least in part, at Earthâ€™s orbital shipyards. Maybe someone will look into that. And thatâ€™s the point. If everyone knows everything, nothing stays secret.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, well,â€� Miller said. Holden ignored him</p>
      <p>â€œEventually, someoneâ€™ll figure out the big picture. This kind of thing requires secrecy to function, so exposing all the secrets hurts them in the end. Itâ€™s the only way this really, permanently stops.â€�</p>
