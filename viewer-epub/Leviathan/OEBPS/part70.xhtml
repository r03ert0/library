      <h2>Leviathan Wakes has a gritty and realistic feel. How much...</h2>
      <p>Okay, so what youâ€™re really asking me there is if this is hard science fiction. The answer is an emphatic no. I have nothing but respect for well-written hard science fiction, and I wanted everything in the book to be plausible enough that it doesnâ€™t get in the way. But the rigorous how-to with the math shown? Itâ€™s not that story. This is working manâ€™s science fiction. Itâ€™s like in Alien, we meet the crew of the Nostromo doing their jobs in this very blue-collar environment. Theyâ€™re truckers, right? Why is there a room in the Nostromo where water leaks down off of chains suspended from the ceiling? Because it looks cool and makes the world feel a little messy. It gives you the feel of the world. Ridley Scott doesnâ€™t explain why that room exists, and when most people watch the film, it never even occurs to them to ask. What kind of drive does the Nostromo use? I bet no one walked out of the film asking that question. I wanted to tell a story about humans living and working in a well-populated solar system. I wanted to convey a feeling of whanted  {g oat that would be like, and then tell a story about the people who live there.</p>
      <p>So how does the Epstein drive work?</p>
      <p>Very well. Efficiently.</p>
      <p>In your acknowledgments you thank the New Mexico Critical Mass writers group. What effect did having that workshop environment have on your work?</p>
      <p>Well, Critical Mass is a lot more than a workshop or critical group. Itâ€™s more like a writerâ€™s mafia. Just about anything you might need, someone in the group can get it for you. Walter Jon Williams, who wrote the brilliant Dread Empireâ€™s Fall space opera series, was there to give important tips about writing in that genre. S. M. Stirling and Victor Milan write some of best action in the business, and there was a lot of action for them to critique. Ian Tregillis is an actual astrophysicist and made himself available for technical questions. Melinda Snodgrass is pretty much the Yoda of letting you know when youâ€™ve wandered too far away from your plot. And the entire group, including Emily Mah, Terry England, and George R. R. Martin, was there to read and critique the early drafts of the book, and a lot of changes were made based on their advice.</p>
      <p>Youâ€™ve worked with George R. R. Martin a lot in the past. What kind of advice did he have for this project?</p>
      <p>Yes, Iâ€™ve done a number of projects with him in one incarnation or another. In this case, he was mostly just encouraging. He likes old-fashioned space opera, and he followed my progress on the book with great interest. He was also the first to read the final version. He was very complimentary. He said at one point that it was the best book about vomit zombies heâ€™d ever read. That was nice.</p>
      <p>Where do you see the Expanse series going from here?</p>
      <p>Well, Iâ€™m contracted with Orbit for at least two more books. They are titled Calibanâ€™s War and Dandelion Sky. I hope to keep exploring the idea of human expansion into the solar system and beyond, and balancing the very real threats that the galaxy poses for the fledgling human diaspora against the threats that those same humans will bring with them. For up-to-date information on what Iâ€™m up to and where the project is headed, people can visit www.the-expanse.com and get the latest.</p>

      <p>Book Two of The Expanse</p>
      <p>by James S. A. Corey</p>
      <p>â€œSnoopyâ€™s out again,â€� Private Hillman said. â€œI think his CO must be pissed at him.â€�</p>
      <p>Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper of the Martian Marine Corps upped the magnification on her armorâ€™s heads-up display and looked in the direction Hillman was pointing. Twenty-five hundred meters away, a squad of four United Nations marines were tromping around their outpost, backlit by the giant greenhouse dome they were guarding. A greenhouse dome identical in nearly all respects to the dome early  ~that was behind her.</p>
      <p>One of the four UN marines had black smudges on the sides of his helmet that looked like beagle ears.</p>
      <p>â€œYep, thatâ€™s Snoopy,â€� Bobbie said. â€œBeen on every patrol detail so far today. Wonder what he did.â€�</p>
      <p>Guard duty around the greenhouses on Ganymede meant doing what you could to keep your mind occupied. Including speculating on the lives of the marines on the other side.</p>
      <p>The other side. Eighteen months before, there hadnâ€™t been sides. The inner planets had all been one big, happy, slightly dysfunctional family. Then the Eros incident, and now the two superpowers were dividing up the solar system between them, and the one moon neither side was willing to give up was Ganymede, breadbasket of the Jovian system.</p>
      <p>As the only moon with any magnetosphere, it was the only place where dome-grown crops stood a chance in Jupiterâ€™s harsh radiation belt, and even there, the domes and habitats had to be shielded to protect civilians from the eight rems a day burning off Jupiter and onto the moonâ€™s surface.</p>
      <p>Bobbieâ€™s armor had been designed to let a soldier walk through a nuclear bomb crater an hour after the blast. It also worked well at keeping Jupiter from frying Martian marines.</p>
      <p>Behind the Earth soldiers on patrol, their dome glowed in a shaft of weak sunlight captured by enormous orbital mirrors. Even with the mirrors, most terrestrial plants would have died, starved of sunlight. Only the heavily modified versions the Ganymede scientists cranked out could hope to survive in the trickle of light the mirrors fed them.</p>
      <p>â€œBe sunset soon,â€� Bobbie said, still watching the Earth marines outside their little guard hut, knowing they were watching her too. In addition to Snoopy, she spotted the one they called Stumpy because he or she couldnâ€™t be much more than a meter and a half tall. She wondered what their nickname for her was. Maybe Big Red. Her armor still had the Martian surface camouflage on it. She hadnâ€™t been on Ganymede long enough to get it resurfaced with mottled gray and white.</p>
      <p>One by one, over the course of five minutes, the orbital mirrors winked out as Ganymede passed behind Jupiter for a few hours. The glow from the greenhouse behind her changed to actinic blue as the artificial lights came on. While the overall light level didnâ€™t go down much, the shadows shifted in strange and subtle ways. Above, the sunâ€”not even a disk from here as much as the brightest starâ€”flashed as it passed behind Jupiterâ€™s limb, and for a moment the planetâ€™s faint ring system was visible.</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™re going back in,â€� Corporal Travis said. â€œSnoopâ€™s bringing up the rear. Poor guy. Can we bail too?â€�</p>
      <p>Bobbie looked around at the featureless dirty ice of Ganymede. Even in her high-tech armor she could feel the moonâ€™s chill.</p>
      <p>â€œNope.â€�</p>
      <p>Her squad grumbled but fell in line as she led them on a slow low-gravity shuffle around the dome. In addition to Hillman and Travis, she had a green private named Gourab on this patrol. And even though heâ€™d been in the marines all of about a minute and a half, he grumbled just as loud as the other two in his Mariner Valley drawl.</p>
      <p>She couldnâ€™t blame them. It was make-work. Something for the Martian soldiers on Ganymede to do to keep them busy. If Earth decided it needed Ganymede all to itself, four grunts walking around the greenhouse dome wouldnâ€™t stop them. With dozens of Earth and Mars warships in a tense stand Marng se stanandoff in orbit, if hostilities broke out, the ground pounders would probably find out only when the surface bombardment began.</p>
      <p>To her left, the dome rose to almost half a kilometer: triangular glass panels separated by gleaming copper-colored struts that turned the entire structure into a massive Faraday cage. Bobbie had never been inside one of the greenhouse domes. Sheâ€™d been sent out from Mars as part of a huge surge in troops to the outer planets and had been walking patrols on the surface almost since day one. Ganymede to her was a spaceport, a small marine base, and the even smaller guard outpost she currently called home.</p>
      <p>As they shuffled around the dome, Bobbie watched the unremarkable landscape. Ganymede didnâ€™t change much without a catastrophic event. The surface was mostly silicate rock and water ice a few degrees warmer than space. The atmosphere was oxygen so thin it could pass as an industrial vacuum. Ganymede didnâ€™t weather. It changed when rocks fell on it from space, or when warm water from the liquid core forced itself onto the surface and created short-lived lakes. Neither thing happened all that often. At home on Mars, wind and dust changed the landscape hourly. Here, she was walking through the footsteps of the day before and the day before and the day before. And if she never came back, those footprints would outlive her. Privately, she thought it was sort of creepy.</p>
      <p>A rhythmic squeaking started to cut through the normally smooth hiss and thump sounds her powered armor made. She usually kept the suitâ€™s HUD minimized. It got so crowded with information that a marine knew everything except what was actually in front of her. Now she pulled it up, using blinks and eye movements to page over to the suitâ€™s diagnostic screen. A yellow telltale warned her that the suitâ€™s left knee actuator was low on hydraulic fluid. Must be a leak somewhere, but a slow one, because the suit couldnâ€™t find it.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, guys, hold up a minute,â€� Bobbie said. â€œHilly, you have any extra hydraulic fluid in your pack?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYep,â€� said Hillman, already pulling it out.</p>
      <p>â€œGive my left knee a squirt, would you?â€�</p>
      <p>While Hillman crouched in front of her, working on her suit, Gourab and Travis began an argument that seemed to be about sports. Bobbie tuned it out.</p>
      <p>â€œThis suit is ancient,â€� Hillman said. â€œYou really oughta upgrade. This sort of thing is just going to happen more and more often, you know.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, I should,â€� Bobbie said. But the truth was that was easier said than done. Bobbie was not the right shape to fit into one of the standard suits, and the marines made her jump through a series of flaming hoops every time she requisitioned a new custom one. At two meters tall, she was only a bit above average height for a Martian male, but thanks in part to her Polynesian ancestry, she weighed in at more than 140 kilos at one g. It wasnâ€™t fat, but her muscles seemed to get bigger every time she even walked through a weight room, and as a marine, she trained all the time.</p>
      <p>The suit she had now was the first one in twelve years of active duty that actually seemed to fit well. And even though it was beginning to show its age, it was just easier to try to keep it running than beg and plead for a new one.</p>
      <p>Hillman was just starting to put his tools away when Bobbieâ€™s radio crackled to life.</p>
      <p>â€œOutpost four to stickman. Come in, stickman.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger four,â€� Bobbie replied. â€œThis is stickman one. Go aheadœThis iht=aheadœT.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œStickman one, where are you guys? Youâ€™re half an hour late and some shit is going down over here.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSorry four, some equipment trouble here,â€� Bobbie said, wondering what sort of shit might be going down, but not enough to ask about it over an open frequency.</p>
      <p>â€œReturn to the outpost immediately. We have shots fired at the UN outpost. Weâ€™re going into lockdown.â€�</p>
      <p>It took Bobbie a moment to parse that. She could see her men staring at her, their faces a mix of puzzlement and fear.</p>
      <p>â€œUh, the Earth guys are shooting at you?â€� she finally asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNot yet, but theyâ€™re shooting. Get your asses back here.â€�</p>
      <p>Hillman jumped to his feet. Bobbie flexed her knee once and got greens on her diagnostic. She gave Hilly a nod of thanks, then said, â€œDouble-time it back to the outpost. Go.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Bobbie and her squad were still half a kilometer from the outpost when the general alert went out. Her suitâ€™s HUD came up on its own, switching to combat mode. The sensor package went to work looking for hostiles and linked up to one of the satellites for a top-down view. She felt the click as the gun built into the suitâ€™s right arm switched to free-fire mode.</p>
      <p>A thousand alarms would be sounding if an orbital bombardment had begun, but she couldnâ€™t help looking up at the sky anyway. No flashes or missile trails. Nothing but Jupiterâ€™s bulk.</p>
      <p>Bobbie took off for the outpost at a dead run. Her squad followed without a word. A person trained in the use of a strength-augmenting suit running in low gravity could cover a lot of ground quickly. The outpost came into view around the curve of the dome in just a few seconds, and a few seconds after that, the cause of the alarm.</p>
      <p>UN marines were charging at the Martian outpost. The yearlong cold war was going hot. Somewhere deep behind the cool mental habits of training and discipline, she was surprised. She hadnâ€™t really thought this day would come.</p>
      <p>The rest of her platoon were out of the outpost and arranged in a firing line facing the UN position. Someone had driven Yojimbo out onto the line, and the four-meter-tall combat mech towered over the other marines, looking like a headless giant in power armor, his massive cannon moving slowly as it tracked the incoming Earth troops. The UN soldiers were covering the 2,500 meters between the two outposts at full speed.</p>
      <p>Why isnâ€™t anyone talking? she wondered. The silence coming from her platoon was eerie.</p>
      <p>And then, just as her squad got to the firing line, her suit squealed a jamming warning at her. The top-down vanished as she lost contact with the satellite. Her teamâ€™s life signs and equipment status reports went dead as her link to their suits was cut off. The faint static of the open comm channel disappeared, leaving an even more unsettling silence.</p>
      <p>She used hand motions to place her team at the right flank, then moved up the line to find Lieutenant Givens, her CO. She spotted his suit right at the center of the line, almost directly under Yojimbo. She ran up and placed her helmet against his.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat the fuck is going on, El Tee?â€� she shouted.</p>
      <p>He gave herem" alithee herem an irritated look and yelled, â€œYour guess is as good as mine. We canâ€™t tell them to back off because of the jamming, and visual warnings are being ignored. Before the radio cut out, I got authorization to fire if they come within half a klick of our position.â€�</p>
      <p>Bobbie had a couple hundred more questions, but the UN troops would cross the five-hundred-meter mark in just a few more seconds, so she ran back to anchor the right flank with her squad. Along the way, she had her suit count the incoming forces and mark them all as hostiles. The suit reported seven targets. Less than a third of the UN troops at their outpost.</p>
      <p>This makes no sense.</p>
      <p>She had her suit draw a line on the HUD at the five-hundred-meter mark. She didnâ€™t tell her boys that was the free-fire zone. She didnâ€™t need to. Theyâ€™d open fire when she did without needing to know why.</p>
      <p>The UN soldiers had crossed the one-kilometer mark, still without firing a shot. They were coming in a scattered formation, with six out front in a ragged line, and a seventh bringing up the rear about seventy meters behind. Her suit HUD selected the figure on the far left of the enemy line as her target, picking the one closest to her by default. Something itched at the back of her brain and she overrode the suit and selected the target at the rear and told it to magnify.</p>
      <p>The small figure suddenly enlarged in her targeting reticule. She felt a chill move down her back and magnified again.</p>
      <p>The figure chasing the six UN marines wasnâ€™t wearing a suit. Nor was it, properly speaking, human. Its skin was covered in chitinous plates, like large black scales. Its head was a massive horror, easily twice as large as it should be and covered in strange protruding growths.</p>
      <p>But most disturbing of all were its hands. Far too large for its body, and too long for their width, they were a childhood-nightmare version of hands. The hands of the troll under the bed or the witch sneaking in through the window. They flexed and grasped at nothing with a constant manic energy.</p>
      <p>The Earth forces werenâ€™t attacking. They were retreating.</p>
      <p>â€œShoot the thing chasing them,â€� Bobbie yelled to no one.</p>
      <p>Before the UN soldiers could cross the half kilometer that would cause the Martians to open fire, the thing caught them.</p>
      <p>â€œOh, holy shit,â€� Bobbie whispered. â€œHoly shit.â€�</p>
      <p>It grabbed one UN marine in its huge hands and tore the man in half like paper. Titanium and ceramic armor tore as easily as the flesh inside, spilling broken bits of technology and wet human viscera indiscriminately onto the ice. The remaining five soldiers ran even harder, but the monster chasing them barely slowed as it killed.</p>
      <p>â€œShoot it shoot it shoot it,â€� Bobbie screamed and opened fire. Bobbieâ€™s training and the technology of her combat suit combined to make her an extremely efficient killing machine. As soon as her finger pulled the trigger on her suitâ€™s gun, a stream of two-millimeter armor-piercing rounds streaked out at the creature at a thousand meters per second. In just under one second, she fired nearly fifty rounds at it. It was a relatively slow-moving human-sized target, running in a straight line. Her targeting computer could do ballistic corrections that would let her hit a softball-sized object moving at supersonic speeds. Every bullet she fired at the monster hit.</p>
      <p>It didnâ€™t matter.</p>
      <p>The rounds we“ alignh=”ds we" nt through it, probably not slowing appreciably before they exited. Each exit wound sprouted a spray of black filaments that fell onto the snow instead of blood. It was like shooting water. The wounds closed almost faster than they were created; the only sign the thing had even been hit was the trail of black fibers in its wake.</p>
      <p>And then it caught a second UN marine. Instead of tearing him to pieces like it had the last one, it spun and hurled the fully armored Eartherâ€”probably massing more than five hundred kilos totalâ€”toward Bobbie. Her HUD tracked the UN soldier on his upward arc and helpfully informed her that the monster had thrown him not toward her, but at her. In a very flat trajectory. Which meant fast.</p>
      <p>She dove to the side as quickly as her suit would let her. The hapless UN marine swiped Hillman, whoâ€™d been standing next to her, and then both of them were gone, bouncing down the ice at lethal speeds.</p>
      <p>By the time she turned back to the monster, it had killed two more UN soldiers.</p>
      <p>The entire Martian line opened fire on it, including Yojimboâ€™s big cannon. The two remaining Earth soldiers diverged and ran at angles away from the thing, trying to give their Martian counterparts an open firing lane. The creature was hit hundreds, thousands of times. It stitched itself back together while remaining at a full run, never more than slowing when one of Yojimboâ€™s cannon shots detonated nearby.</p>
      <p>Bobbie, back on her feet, joined in the barrage but it didnâ€™t make any difference. The creature slammed into the Martian line, killing two marines faster than the eye could follow. Yojimbo slid to one side, far more nimble than a machine of its size should be. Bobbie though Saâ€™id must be driving it. He swore he could make the big mech dance the tango when he wanted to. It didnâ€™t matter. Even before Saâ€™id could bring the mechâ€™s cannon around for a point-blank shot, the creature ran right up its side, gripped the pilot hatch, and tore the door off its hinges. Saâ€™id was snatched from his cockpit harness and hurled sixty meters straight up.</p>
      <p>The other marines had begun to fall back, firing as they went. Without radio, there was no way to coordinate the retreat. Bobbie found herself running toward the dome with the rest. The small and distant part of her mind that wasnâ€™t panicking knew that the domeâ€™s glass and metal would offer no protection against something that could tear an armored man in half and rip a nine-ton mech to pieces. That part of her mind recognized the futility in attempting to override her terror.</p>
      <p>By the time she found the external door to the dome, there was only one other marine left with her. Gourab. Up close, she could see his face through the armored glass of his helmet. He was screaming something at her she couldnâ€™t hear. She started to lean forward to touch helmets with him when he shoved her backward onto the ice. He was hammering on the door controls with one metal fist, trying to smash his way in in his mindless panic, when the creature caught him and peeled the helmet off his suit. Gourab stood for one moment, face in vacuum, eyes blinking and mouth open in a soundless scream; then the creature tore off his head as easily as it had his helmet.</p>
      <p>It turned and looked at Bobbie, still flat on her back.</p>
      <p>Up close, she could see that it had bright blue eyes. A glowing, electric blue. They were beautiful. She raised her gun and held down the trigger for half a second before she realized sheâ€™d run out of ammo long before. The creature looked at her gun with what she would have sworn was curiosity, then looked into her eyes and cocked its heinto hekedts heinad to one side.</p>
      <p>This is it, she thought. This is how I go out, and Iâ€™m not going to know what did it, or why. Dying she could handle. Dying without any answers seemed terribly cruel.</p>
      <p>The creature took one step toward her, then stopped and shuddered. A new pair of limbs burst out of its midsection and writhed in the air like tentacles. Its head, already grotesque, seemed to swell up. The blue eyes flashed as bright as the lights in the domes.</p>
      <p>And then it exploded in a ball of fire that hurled her away across the ice and slammed her into a low ridge hard enough for the impact-absorbing gel in her suit to go rigid, freezing her in place.</p>
      <p>She lay on her back, fading toward unconsciousness. The night sky above her began to flash with light. The ships in orbit, shooting.</p>
      <p>Cease fire, she thought, pressing the thought out into the blackness. They were retreating. Cease fire. Her radio was still out. She couldnâ€™t tell anyone that the UN marines hadnâ€™t been attacking.</p>
      <p>Or that something else had.</p>
