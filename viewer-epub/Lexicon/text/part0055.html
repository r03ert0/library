			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Subhead"><em class="calibre1">The Sydney Morning Herald, Vol. 183 Issue 217 Page 14</em></p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-First">A government body charged with reviewing the toxicity of Broken Hill—site of the 2019 disaster that killed more than three thousand people—has recommended that the town remain fenced off for an indeterminate time.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The review was triggered by photographs last summer of what appear to be two large helicopters hovering over the town. This fueled long-running local speculation that the town was not uninhabitable, with conspiracy theories proclaiming the town as home to everything from a secret mafia treasure trove to government military programs.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The review, which published a 300-page report today, should hose down such talk, with scientists finding critically high levels of methyl isocarbonate still present in the soil.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">“As much as I enjoy a good story, it would be highly dangerous to start thinking it’s okay to go have a look at Broken Hill,” said spokesperson Henry Lawson. “The town is, unfortunately, a grim reminder of what can happen when people and businesses operate without proper oversight.”</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-Last">Broken Hill remains the site of one of the world’s worst environmental disasters.</p>
