      <h2>Havelock leaned back, lips pressed thin and bloodless....</h2>
      <p>â€œWell,â€� Miller said, â€œcalled that one wrong.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhich one?â€� Havelock said.</p>
      <p>â€œOPAâ€™s not moving in on the criminals,â€� Miller said. â€œTheyâ€™re moving in on the cops.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Eleven: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The Donnager was ugly.</p>
      <p>Holden had seen pictures and videos of the old oceangoing navies of Earth, and even in the age of steel, there had always been something beautiful about them. Long and sleek, they had the appearance of something leaning into the wind, a creature barely held on the leash. The Donnager had none of that. Like all long-flight spacecraft, it was built in the â€œoffice towerâ€� configuration: each deck one floor of the building, ladders or elevators running down the axis. Constant thrust took the place of gravity.</p>
      <p>But the Donnager actually looked like an office building on its side. Square and blocky, with small bulbous projections in seemingly random places. At nearly five hundred meters long, it was the size of a 130-story building. Alex had said it was 250,000 tons dry weight, and it looked heavier. Holden reflected, not for the first time, on how so much of the human sense of aesthetics had been formed in a time when sleek objects cut through the air. The Donnager would never move through anything thicker than interstellar gas, so curves and angles were a waste of space. The result was ugly.</p>
      <p>It was also intimidating. As Holden watched from his seat next to Alex in the cockpit of the Knight, the massive battleship matched course with them, looming close and then seeming to stop above them. A docking bay opened, breaking up the Donnagerâ€™s flat black belly with a sreaking uquare of dim red light. The Knight beeped insistently, reminding him of the targeting lasers painting their hull. Holden looked for the point defense cannons aimed at him. He couldnâ€™t find them.</p>
      <p>When Alex spoke, Holden jumped.</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that, Donnager,â€� the pilot said. â€œWeâ€™ve got steering lock. Iâ€™m killing thrust.â€�</p>
      <p>The last shreds of weight vanished. Both ships were still moving at hundreds of kilometers a minute, but their matched courses felt like stillness.</p>
      <p>â€œGot docking permission, Cap. Take her in?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt seems late to make a run for it, Mr. Kamal,â€� Holden said. He imagined Alex making a mistake that the Donnager interpreted as threatening, and the point defense cannons throwing a couple hundred thousand Teflon-coated chunks of steel through them.</p>
      <p>â€œGo slowly, Alex,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œThey say one of those can kill a planet,â€� Naomi said over the comm. She was at the ops station a deck below.</p>
      <p>â€œAnyone can kill a planet from orbit,â€� Holden replied. â€œYou donâ€™t even need bombs. Just push anvils out the airlock. That thing out there could killâ€¦ Shit. Anything.â€�</p>
      <p>Tiny touches shifted them as the maneuvering rockets fired. Holden knew that Alex was guiding them in, but he couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that the Donnager was swallowing them.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Docking took nearly an hour. Once the Knight was inside the bay, a massive manipulator arm grabbed her and put it down in an empty section of the deck. Clamps grabbed the ship, the Knightâ€™s hull reverberating with a metallic bang that reminded Holden of a brig cellâ€™s maglocks.</p>
      <p>The Martians ran a docking tube from one wall and mated up to the Knightâ€™s airlock. Holden gathered the crew at the inner door.</p>
      <p>â€œNo guns, no knives, no anything that might look like a weapon,â€� he said. â€œTheyâ€™ll probably be okay with hand terminals, but keep them turned off just in case. If they ask for it, hand it over without complaint. Our survival here may rest on them thinking weâ€™re very compliant.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Amos said. â€œFuckers killed McDowell, but we have to act niceâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>Alex started to respond, but Holden cut him off.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex, you did twenty flying with the MCRN. Anything else we should know?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSame stuff you said, Boss,â€� Alex replied. â€œYes sir, no sir, and snap to when given an order. The enlisted guys will be okay, but the officers get the sense of humor trained out of â€™em.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden looked at his tiny crew, hoping he hadnâ€™t killed them all by bringing them here. He cycled open the lock, and they drifted down the short docking tube in the zero g. When they reached the airlock at the endâ€”flat gray composites and immaculately cleanâ€”everyone pushed down to the floor. Their magnetic boots grabbed on. The airlock closed and hissed at them for several seconds before opening into a larger room with about a dozen people standing in it. Holden recognized Captain Theresa Yao. There were several others in naval officersâ€™ dress, who were part of her staff; one man in an enlisted uniform with a look of thinly veiled impatience; and six marines orm wi main heavy combat armor, carrying assault rifles. The rifles were pointed at him, so Holden put up his hands.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™re not armed,â€� he said, smiling and trying to look harmless.</p>
      <p>The rifles didnâ€™t waver, but Captain Yao stepped forward.</p>
      <p>â€œWelcome aboard the Donnager,â€� she said. â€œChief, check them.â€�</p>
      <p>The enlisted man clumped toward them and quickly and professionally patted them all down. He gave the thumbs-up to one of the marines. The rifles went down, and Holden worked hard not to sigh with relief.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat now, Captain?â€� Holden asked, keeping his voice light.</p>
      <p>Yao looked Holden over critically for several seconds before answering. Her hair was pulled tightly back, the few strands of gray making straight lines. In person, he could see the softening of age at her jaw and the corners of her eyes. Her stony expression had the same quiet arrogance that all the naval captains heâ€™d known shared. He wondered what she saw, looking at him. He resisted the urge to straighten his greasy hair.</p>
      <p>â€œChief Gunderson will take you down to your rooms and get you settled in,â€� she replied. â€œSomeone will be along shortly to debrief you.â€�</p>
      <p>Chief Gunderson started to lead them from the room when Yao spoke again, her voice suddenly hard.</p>
      <p>â€œMr. Holden, if you know anything about the six ships that are following you, speak now,â€� she said. â€œWe gave them a two-hour deadline to change course about an hour ago. So far they havenâ€™t. In one hour Iâ€™m going to order a torpedo launch. If theyâ€™re friends of yours, you could save them a great deal of pain.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden shook his head emphatically.</p>
      <p>â€œAll I know is they came out of the Belt when you started out to meet us, Captain,â€� Holden said. â€œThey havenâ€™t talked to us. Our best guess is theyâ€™re concerned citizens of the Belt coming to watch what happens.â€�</p>
      <p>Yao nodded. If she found the thought of witnesses disconcerting, it didnâ€™t show.</p>
      <p>â€œTake them below, Chief,â€� she said, then turned away.</p>
      <p>Chief Gunderson gave a soft whistle and pointed at one of the two doors. Holdenâ€™s crew followed him out, the marines bringing up the rear. As they moved through the Donnager, Holden took his first really up-close look at a Martian capital ship. Heâ€™d never served on a battleship in the UN Navy, and heâ€™d stepped foot on them maybe three times in seven years, always in dock, and usually for a party. Every inch of the Donnager was just a little sharper than any UN vessel heâ€™d served on. Mars really does build them better than we do.</p>
      <p>â€œGoddamn, XO, they sure do keep their shit squeaky clean,â€� Amos said behind him.</p>
      <p>â€œAinâ€™t much to do on a long flight for most of the crew, Amos,â€� Alex said. â€œSo when you arenâ€™t doinâ€™ somethinâ€™ else, you clean.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSee, thatâ€™s why I work haulers,â€� Amos said. â€œClean decks or get drunk and screw, and Iâ€™ve got a preference.â€�</p>
      <p>As they walked through a maze of corridors, the ship started a slight vibration, and gravity slowly reappeared. They were under thrust. Holden used his heels to touch his bootsâ€™ slide controls, turning the magnets off.</p>
      <p>They saw almost no one, and the few they did see moved fast and said little, barone, attlely sparing them a glance. With six ships closing on them, everyone would be at their duty stations. When Captain Yao had said sheâ€™d fire her torpedoes in an hour, there hadnâ€™t been a hint of threat in her voice. It was just a flat statement of fact. For most of the young sailors on this ship, it would probably be the first time theyâ€™d ever been in a live combat situationâ€”if it came to that. Holden didnâ€™t believe it would.</p>
      <p>He wondered what to make of the fact that Yao was prepared to take out a handful of Belt ships just because they were running quiet and close. It didnâ€™t suggest that theyâ€™d hesitate to kill a water hauler, like the Cant, if they thought there was reason to.</p>
      <p>Gunderson brought them to a stop in front of a hatch with OQ117 printed on it. He slid a card through the lock and gestured everyone inside.</p>
      <p>â€œBetter than Iâ€™d expected,â€� Shed said, sounding impressed.</p>
      <p>The compartment was large by ship standards. It had six high-g couches and a small table with four chairs stuck to the deck with magnetic feet. An open door in one bulkhead showed a smaller compartment with a toilet and sink. Gunderson and the marine lieutenant followed the crew inside.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is your rack for the time being,â€� the chief said. â€œThereâ€™s a comm panel on the wall. Two of Lieutenant Kellyâ€™s people will be stationed outside. Buzz them and theyâ€™ll send for anything you need.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow about some chow?â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™ll have some sent up. You are to remain here until called for,â€� Gunderson said. â€œLieutenant Kelly, you have anything to add, sir?â€�</p>
      <p>The marine lieutenant looked them over.</p>
      <p>â€œThe men outside are there for your protection, but they will react unpleasantly if you make any trouble,â€� he said. â€œYou read me?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLoud and clear, Lieutenant,â€� Holden said. â€œDonâ€™t worry. My people will be the easiest houseguests youâ€™ve ever had.â€�</p>
      <p>Kelly nodded at Holden with what seemed like genuine gratitude. He was a professional doing an unpleasant job. Holden sympathized. Also, heâ€™d known enough marines to know how unpleasant it could get if they felt challenged.</p>
      <p>Gunderson said, â€œCan you take Mr. Holden here to his appointment on your way out, El Tee? Iâ€™d like to get these folks squared away.â€�</p>
      <p>Kelly nodded and took Holdenâ€™s elbow.</p>
      <p>â€œCome with me, sir,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhere am I going, Lieutenant?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLieutenant Lopez asked to see you as soon as you landed. Iâ€™m taking you to him.â€�</p>
      <p>Shed looked nervously from the marine to Holden and back. Naomi nodded. Theyâ€™d all see each other again, Holden told himself. He even thought it was likely to be true.</p>
      <p>Kelly led Holden at a brisk pace through the ship. His rifle was no longer at the ready but hanging from his shoulder loosely. Either heâ€™d decided Holden wasnâ€™t going to cause trouble, or that he could take him down easily if he did.</p>
      <p>â€œCan I ask who Lieutenant Lopez is?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHeâ€™s the guy who asked to see you,â€� Kelly said.</p>
      <p>Kelly stopped at a plain gray door, rapped once, then took Holden inside a small compartment with a table and two uncomfortable-nside forlooking chairs. A dark-haired man was setting up a recorder. He waved one hand vaguely in the direction of a chair. Holden sat. The chair was even less comfortable than it looked.</p>
      <p>â€œYou can go, Mr. Kelly,â€� the man Holden assumed was Lopez said. Kelly left and closed the door.</p>
      <p>When Lopez had finished, he sat down across the table from Holden and reached out one hand. Holden shook it.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m Lieutenant Lopez. Kelly probably told you that. I work for naval intelligence, which he almost certainly didnâ€™t tell you. My job isnâ€™t secret, but they train jarheads to be tight-lipped.â€�</p>
      <p>Lopez reached into his pocket, took out a small packet of white lozenges, and popped one into his mouth. He didnâ€™t offer one to Holden. Lopezâ€™s pupils contracted to tiny points as he sucked the lozenge. Focus drugs. Heâ€™d be watching every tic of Holdenâ€™s face during questioning. Tough to lie to.</p>
      <p>â€œFirst Lieutenant James R. Holden, of Montana,â€� he said. It wasnâ€™t a question.</p>
      <p>â€œYes, sir,â€� Holden said anyway.</p>
      <p>â€œSeven years in the UNN, last posting on the destroyer Zhang Fei.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYour file says you were busted out for assaulting a superior officer,â€� Lopez said. â€œThatâ€™s pretty clichÃ©, Holden. You punched the old man? Seriously?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo. I missed. Broke my hand on a bulkhead.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHowâ€™d that happen?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe was quicker than I expected,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>â€œWhyâ€™d you try?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI was projecting my self-loathing onto him. Itâ€™s just a stroke of luck that I actually wound up hurting the right person,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œSounds like youâ€™ve thought about it some since then,â€� Lopez said, his pinprick pupils never moving from Holdenâ€™s face. â€œ Therapy?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLots of time to think on the Canterbury,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>Lopez ignored the obvious opening and said, â€œWhat did you come up with, during all that thinking?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Coalition has been stepping on the necks of the people out here for over a hundred years now. I didnâ€™t like being the boot.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAn OPA sympathizer, then?â€� Lopez said, his expression not changing at all.</p>
      <p>â€œNo. I didnâ€™t switch sides. I stopped playing. I didnâ€™t renounce my citizenship. I like Montana. Iâ€™m out here because I like flying, and only a Belter rust trap like the Canterbury will hire me.â€�</p>
      <p>Lopez smiled for the first time. â€œYouâ€™re an exceedingly honest man, Mr. Holden.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy did you claim that a Martian military vessel destroyed your ship?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI didnâ€™t. I explained all that in the broadcast. It had technology only available to inner planet fleets, and I found a piece of MCRN hardware in the device that tricked us into stopping.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™ll want to see that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re welcome to it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYour file says you were the only child of a family co-op,â€� Lopez said,ays yopez acting as though theyâ€™d never stopped talking about Holdenâ€™s past.</p>
      <p>â€œYes, five fathers, three mothers.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo many parents for only one child,â€� Lopez said, slowly unwrapping another lozenge. The Martians had lots of space for traditional families.</p>
      <p>â€œThe tax break for eight adults only having one child allowed them to own twenty-two acres of decent farmland. There are over thirty billion people on Earth. Twenty-two acres is a national park,â€� Holden said. â€œAlso, the DNA mix is legit. They arenâ€™t parents in name only.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow did they decide who carried you?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMother Elise had the widest hips.â€�</p>
      <p>Lopez popped the second lozenge into his mouth and sucked on it a few moments. Before he could speak again, the deck shook. The video recorder jiggled on its arm.</p>
      <p>â€œTorpedo launches?â€� Holden said. â€œGuess those Belt ships didnâ€™t change course.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAny thoughts about that, Mr. Holden?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJust that you seem pretty willing to kill Belt ships.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve put us in a position where we canâ€™t afford to seem weak. After your accusations, there are a lot of people who donâ€™t think much of us.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden shrugged. If the man was watching for guilt or remorse from Holden, he was out of luck. The Belt ships had known what they were going toward. They hadnâ€™t turned away. But still, something bothered him.</p>
      <p>â€œThey might hate your living guts,â€� Holden said. â€œBut itâ€™s hard to find enough suicidal people to crew six ships. Maybe they think they can outrun torpedoes.â€�</p>
      <p>Lopez didnâ€™t move, his whole body preternaturally still with the focus drugs pouring through him.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€”â€� Lopez began, and the general quarters Klaxon sounded. It was deafening in the small metal compartment.</p>
      <p>â€œHoly shit, did they shoot back?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>Lopez shook himself, like a man waking up from a daydream. He got up and hit the comm button by the door. A marine came through seconds later.</p>
      <p>â€œTake Mr. Holden back to his quarters,â€� Lopez said, then left the room at a run.</p>
      <p>The marine gestured at the corridor with the barrel of his rifle. His expression was hard.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s all fun and games till someone shoots back, Holden thought.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Naomi patted the empty couch next to her and smiled.</p>
      <p>â€œDid they put slivers under your fingernails?â€� she asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNo, actually, he was surprisingly human for a naval intelligence wonk,â€� Holden replied. â€œOf course, he was just getting warmed up. Have you guys heard anything about the other ships?â€�</p>
      <p>Alex said, â€œNope. But that alarm means theyâ€™re takinâ€™ them seriously all of a sudden.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s insane,â€� Shed said quietly. â€œFlying around in these metal bubbles, and then trying to poke holes in each other. You ever seen what long-term decompression and cold exposure does? Breaks all the capillariecomprcapes in your eyes and skin. Tissue damage to the lungs can cause massive pneumonia followed by emphysema-like scarring. I mean, if you donâ€™t just die.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWell, thatâ€™s awful fucking cheerful, Doc. Thanks for that,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>The ship suddenly vibrated in a syncopated but ultra-high-speed rhythm. Alex looked at Holden, his eyes wide.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s the point defense network openinâ€™ up. That means incoming torpedoes,â€� he said. â€œBetter strap in tight, kids. The ship might start doinâ€™ some violent maneuvering.â€�</p>
      <p>Everyone but Holden was already belted into the couches. He fastened his restraints too.</p>
      <p>â€œThis sucks. All the real action is happeninâ€™ thousands of klicks from here, and we got no instruments to look at,â€� Alex said. â€œWe wonâ€™t know if somethinâ€™ slipped through the flack screen till it rips the hull open.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBoy, everybody is just a fucking pile of fun right now,â€� Amos said loudly.</p>
      <p>Shedâ€™s eyes were wide, his face too pale. Holden shook his head.</p>
      <p>â€œNot going to happen,â€� he said. â€œThis thing is unkillable. Whoever those ships are, they can put on a good show, but thatâ€™s it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAll respect, Captain,â€� Naomi said. â€œBut whoever those ships are, they should be dead already, and they arenâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>The distant noises of faraway combat kept up. The occasional rumble of a torpedo firing. The near-constant vibration of the high-speed point defense guns. Holden didnâ€™t realize heâ€™d fallen asleep until he was jerked awake by an earsplitting roar. Amos and Alex were yelling. Shed was screaming.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat happened?â€� Holden yelled over the noise.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™re hit, Cap!â€� Alex said. â€œThat was a torpedo hit!â€�</p>
      <p>The gravity suddenly dropped away. The Donnager had stopped its engines. Or theyâ€™d been destroyed.</p>
      <p>Amos was still yelling, â€œShit shit shit,â€� over everything. But at least Shed had stopped screaming. He was staring wide eyed out of his couch, his face white. Holden unbuckled his straps and pushed off toward the comm panel.</p>
      <p>â€œJim!â€� Naomi called out. â€œWhat are you doing?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe need to find out whatâ€™s going on,â€� Holden said over his shoulder.</p>
      <p>When he reached the bulkhead by the hatch, he punched the comm panel call button. There was no reply. He hit it again, then started pounding on the hatch. No one came.</p>
      <p>â€œWhere are our damn marines?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>The lights dimmed, came back up. Then again, and again, in a slow cadence.</p>
      <p>â€œGauss turrets firing. Shit. Itâ€™s CQB,â€� Alex said in awe.</p>
      <p>In the history of the Coalition, no capital ship had ever gotten into a close-quarters battle. But here they were, firing the shipâ€™s big cannons, which meant that the range was sufficiently short that a nonguided weapon was viable. Hundreds or even dozens of kilometers, not thousands. Somehow the Belt ships had survived Donnagerâ€™s torpedo barrage.</p>
