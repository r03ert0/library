      <h2>Kelly pointed at them and looked at Holden. Holden nodded...</h2>
      <p>Kelly folded up the last finger on his hand, planted his feet on the wall, and pushed off toward their corvette. Holden waited for Alex, Amos, and Naomi, then shoved off last. By the time he was in motion, Gomez was firing from a new location. One of the boarders on the deck pointed a large weapon toward the muzzle flash from Gomezâ€™s gun. Gomez and the crate heâ€™d been taking cover behind disappeared in fire and shrapnel.</p>
      <p>They were halfway to the ship and Holden was starting to think they might make it when a line of smoke crossed the room and intersected with Kelly, and the lieutenant disappeared in a flash of light.</p>
      <p>Chapter Fourteen: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The Xinglong died stupid. Afterward, everyone knew she was one of thousands of small-time rock-hopping prospector ships. The Belt was lousy with them: five- or six-family operations that had scraped together enough for a down payment and set up operations. When it happened, theyâ€™d been three payments behind, and their bankâ€”Consolidated Holdings and Investmentsâ€”had put a lien on the ship. Which, common wisdom had it, was why they had disabled her transponder. Just honest folks with a rust bucket to call their own trying to keep flying.</p>
      <p>If you wereem" , c… going to make a poster of the Belterâ€™s dream, it would have been the Xinglong.</p>
      <p>The Scipio Africanus, a patrol destroyer, was due to head back down toward Mars at the end of its two-year tour of the Belt. They both headed for a captured cometary body a few hundred thousand kilometers from Chiron to top off their water.</p>
      <p>When the prospecting ship first came in range, the Scipio saw a fast-moving ship running dark and headed more or less in their direction. The official Martian press releases all said that the Scipio had tried repeatedly to hail her. The OPA pirate casts all said it was crap and that no listening station in the Belt had heard anything like that. Everyone agreed that the Scipio had opened its point defense cannons and turned the prospecting ship into glowing slag.</p>
      <p>The reaction had been as predictable as elementary physics. The Martians were diverting another couple dozen ships to help â€œmaintain order.â€� The OPAâ€™s shriller talking heads called for open war, and fewer and fewer of the independent sites and casts were disagreeing with them. The great, implacable clockwork of war ticked one step closer to open fighting.</p>
      <p>And someone on Ceres had put a Martian-born citizen named Enrique Dos Santos through eight or nine hours of torture and nailed the remains to a wall near sector elevenâ€™s water reclamation works. They identified him by the terminal that had been left on the floor along with the manâ€™s wedding ring and a thin faux-leather wallet with his credit access data and thirty thousand Europa-script new yen. The dead Martian had been affixed to the wall with a single-charge prospectorâ€™s spike. Five hours afterward, the air recyclers were still laboring to get the acid smell out. The forensics team had taken their samples. They were about ready to cut the poor bastard down.</p>
      <p>It always surprised Miller how peaceful dead people looked. However godawful the circumstances, the slack calm that came at the end looked like sleep. It made him wonder if when his turn came, heâ€™d actually feel that last relaxation.</p>
      <p>â€œSurveillance cameras?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œBeen out for three days,â€� his new partner said. â€œKids busted â€™em.â€�</p>
      <p>Octavia Muss was originally from crimes against persons, back before Star Helix split violence up into smaller specialties. From there, sheâ€™d been on the rape squad. Then a couple of months of crimes against children. If the woman still had a soul, it had been pressed thin enough to see through. Her eyes never registered anything more than mild surprise.</p>
      <p>â€œWe know which kids?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSome punks from upstairs,â€� she said. â€œBooked, fined, released into the wild.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe should round â€™em back up,â€� Miller said. â€œItâ€™d be interesting to know whether someone paid them to take out these particular cameras.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™d bet against it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThen whoever did this had to know that these cameras were busted.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSomeone in maintenance?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOr a cop.â€�</p>
      <p>Muss smacked her lips and shrugged. Sheâ€™d come from three generations in the Belt. She had family on ships like the one the Scipio had killed. The skin and bone and gristle hanging in front of them were no surprise to her. You dropped a hammer under thrust, and it fell to the deck. Your government slaughtered six families of ethnic Chinese prospectores o">Mospectors, someone pinned you to the living rock of Ceres with a three-foot titanium alloy spike. Same same.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s going to be consequences,â€� Miller said, meaning This isnâ€™t a corpse, itâ€™s a billboard. Itâ€™s a call to war.</p>
      <p>â€œThere ainâ€™t,â€� Muss said. The war is here anyway, banner or no.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. â€œYouâ€™re right. There ainâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou want to do next of kin? Iâ€™ll go take a look at outlying video. They didnâ€™t burn his fingers off here in the corridor, so they had to haul him in from somewhere.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. â€œIâ€™ve got a sympathy form letter I can fire off. Wife?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t know,â€� she said. â€œHavenâ€™t looked.â€�</p>
      <p>Back at the station house, Miller sat alone at his desk. Muss already had her own desk, two cubicles over and customized the way she liked it. Havelockâ€™s desk was empty and cleaned twice over, as if the custodial services had wanted the smell of Earth off their good Belter chair. Miller pulled up the dead manâ€™s file, found the next of kin. Jun-Yee Dos Santos, working on Ganymede. Married six years. No kids. Well, there was something to be glad of, at least. If you were going to die, at least you shouldnâ€™t leave a mark.</p>
      <p>He navigated to the form letter, dropped in the new widowâ€™s name and contact address. Dear Mrs. Dos Santos, I am very sorry to have to tell you blah blah blah. Your [he spun through the menu] husband was a valued and respected member of the Ceres community, and I assure you that everything possible will be done to see that her [Miller toggled that] his killer or killers will be brought to answer for this. Yoursâ€¦</p>
      <p>It was inhuman. It was impersonal and cold and as empty as vacuum. The hunk of flesh on that corridor wall had been a real man with passions and fears, just like anyone else. Miller wanted to wonder what it said about him that he could ignore that fact so easily, but the truth was he knew. He sent the message and tried not to dwell on the pain it was about to cause.</p>
      <p>The board was thick. The incident count was twice what it should have been. This is what it looks like, he thought. No riots. No hole-by-hole military action or marines in the corridors. Just a lot of unsolved homicides.</p>
      <p>Then he corrected himself: This is what it looks like so far.</p>
      <p>It didnâ€™t make his next task any easier.</p>
      <p>Shaddid was in her office.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat can I do for you?â€� she asked.</p>
      <p>â€œI need to make some requisitions for interrogation transcripts,â€� he said. â€œBut itâ€™s a little irregular. I was thinking it might be better if it came through you.â€�</p>
      <p>Shaddid sat back in her chair.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll look at it,â€� she said. â€œWhat are we trying to get?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded, as if by signaling yes himself, he could get her to say the same.</p>
      <p>â€œJim Holden. The Earther from the Canterbury. Mars should be picking his people up around now, and I need to petition for the debriefing transcripts.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou have a case that goes back to the Canterbury?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� he said. â€œSeems like I do.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTell me,â€� she said. â€œTell me now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s the side job. Julie Mao. Iâ€™ve been looking into itâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI saw your report.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo you know sheâ€™s associated with the OPA. From what Iâ€™ve found, it looks like she was on a freighter that was doing courier runs for them.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou have proof of that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI have an OPA guy that said as much.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOn the record?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Miller said. â€œIt was informal.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd it tied into the Martian navy killing the Canterbury how?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe was on the Scopuli,â€� Miller said. â€œIt was used as bait to stop the Canterbury. The thing is, you look at the broadcasts Holden makes, he talks about finding it with a Mars Navy beacon and no crew.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd you think thereâ€™s something in there thatâ€™ll help you?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWonâ€™t know until I see it,â€� Miller said. â€œBut if Julie wasnâ€™t on that freighter, then someone had to take her off.â€�</p>
      <p>Shaddidâ€™s smile didnâ€™t reach her eyes.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd you would like to ask the Martian navy to please hand over whatever they got from Holden.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf he saw something on that boat, something thatâ€™ll give us an idea what happened to Julie and the otherâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou arenâ€™t thinking this through,â€� Shaddid said. â€œThe Mars Navy killed the Canterbury. They did it to provoke a reaction from the Belt so theyâ€™d have an excuse to roll in and take us over. The only reason theyâ€™re â€˜debriefingâ€™ the survivors is so that no one could get to the poor bastards first. Holden and his crew are either dead or getting their minds cored out by Martian interrogation specialists right now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe canâ€™t be sureâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd even if I could get a full record of what they said as each toenail got ripped off, it would do you exactly no good, Miller. The Martian navy isnâ€™t going to ask about the Scopuli. They know good and well what happened to the crew. They planted the Scopuli.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIs that Star Helixâ€™s official stand?â€� Miller asked. The words were barely out of his mouth before he saw theyâ€™d been a mistake. Shaddidâ€™s face closed down like a light going out. Now that heâ€™d said it, he saw the implied threat heâ€™d just made.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m just pointing out the source reliability issue,â€� Shaddid said. â€œYou donâ€™t go to the suspect and ask where they think you should look next. And the Juliette Mao retrieval isnâ€™t your first priority.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not saying it is,â€� Miller said, chagrined to hear the defensiveness in his voice.</p>
      <p>â€œWe have a board out there thatâ€™s full and getting fuller. Our first priorities are safety and continuity of services. If what youâ€™re doing isnâ€™t directly related to that, there are better things for you to be doing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThis warâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIsnâ€™t our job,â€� Shaddid said. â€œOur job is Ceres. Get me a final report on Juliette Mao. Iâ€™ll send it through channels. Weâ€™ve done what we could.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t thinkâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI do,â€� Shaddid said. â€œWeâ€™ve done what we could. Now stop being a pussy, get your ass out there, and catch bad guys. Detective.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes, Captain,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Muss was sitting at Millerâ€™s desk when he got back to it, a cup in her hand that was either strong tea or weak coffee. She nodded toward his desktop monitor. On it, three Beltersâ€”two men and one womanâ€”were coming out of a warehouse door, an orange plastic shipping container carried between them. Miller raised his eyebrows.</p>
      <p>â€œEmployed by an independent gas-hauling company. Nitrogen, oxygen. Basic atmospherics. Nothing exotic. Looks like they had the poor bastard in one of the company warehouses. Iâ€™ve sent forensics over to see if we can get any blood splatters for confirmation.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood work,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Muss shrugged. Adequate work, she seemed to say.</p>
      <p>â€œWhere are the perps?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œShipped out yesterday,â€� she said. â€œFlight plan logs them as headed for Io.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIo?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEarth-Mars Coalition central,â€� Muss said. â€œWant to put any money on whether they actually show up there?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure,â€� Miller said. â€œIâ€™ll lay you fifty that they donâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>Muss actually laughed.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve put them on the alert system,â€� she said. â€œAnyplace they land, the locals will have a heads-up and a tracking number for the Dos Santos thing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo case closed,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œChalk another one up for the good guys,â€� Muss agreed.</p>
      <p>The rest of the day was hectic. Three assaults, two of them overtly political and one domestic. Muss and Miller cleared all three from the board before the end of shift. There would be more by tomorrow.</p>
      <p>After he clocked out, Miller stopped at a food cart near one of the tube stations for a bowl of vat rice and textured protein that approximated teriyaki chicken. All around him on the tube, normal citizens of Ceres read their newsfeeds and listened to music. A young couple half a car up from him leaned close to each other, murmuring and giggling. They might have been sixteen. Seventeen. He saw the boyâ€™s wrist snake up under the girlâ€™s shirt. She didnâ€™t protest. An old woman directly across from Miller slept, her head lolling against the wall of the car, her snores almost delicate.</p>
      <p>These people were what it was all about, Miller told himself. Normal people living small lives in a bubble of rock surrounded by hard vacuum. If they let the station turn into a riot zone, let order fail, all these lives would get turned into kibble like a kitten in a meat grinder. Making sure it didnâ€™t happen was for people like him, Muss, even Shaddid.</p>
      <p>So, a small voice said in the back of his mind, why isnâ€™t it your job to stop Mars from dropping a nuke and cracking Ceres like an egg? Whatâ€™s the bigger threat to that guy standing over there, a few unlicensed whores or a Belt at war with Mars?</p>
      <p>What was the harm that could come from knowing what happened to the Scopuli?</p>
      <p>But of course he knew the answer to that. He couldnâ€™t judge how dangerous the truth was until he knew itâ€”which was itself a fine reason to keep going.</p>
      <p>The OPA man, Anderson Dawes, was sitting on a cloth folding chair outside Millerâ€™s hole, reading a book. It was a real bookâ€”onionskin pages bound in what might have been actual leather. Miller had seen pictures of them before; the idea of that much weight for a single megabyte of data struck him as decadent.</p>
      <p>â€œDetective.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMr. Dawes.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI was hoping we could talk.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller was glad, as they went inside together, that heâ€™d cleaned up a little. All the beer bottles had gone to recycler. The tables and cabinets were dusted. The cushions on the chairs had all been mended or replaced. As Dawes took his seat, Miller realized heâ€™d done the housework in anticipation of this meeting. He hadnâ€™t realized it until now.</p>
      <p>Dawes put his book on the table, dug in his jacket pocket, and slid a thin black filmdrive across the table. Miller picked it up.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat am I going to see on this?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNothing you canâ€™t confirm in the records,â€� Dawes answered.</p>
      <p>â€œAnything fabricated?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes,â€� Dawes said. His grin did nothing to improve his appearance. â€œBut not by us. You asked about the police riot gear. It was signed for by a Sergeant Pauline Trikoloski for transfer to special services unit twenty-three.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSpecial services twenty-three?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes,â€� Dawes said. â€œIt doesnâ€™t exist. Nor does Trikoloski. The equipment was all boxed up, signed for, and delivered to a dock. The freighter in the berth at the time was registered to the CorporaÃ§Ãµ do Gato Preto.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBlack Cat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou know them?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œImport-export, same as everyone else,â€� Miller said with a shrug. â€œWe investigated them as a possible front for the Loca Greiga. Never tied them down, though.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou were right.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou prove it?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot my job,â€� Dawes said. â€œBut this might interest you. Automated docking logs for the ship when she left here and when she arrived on Ganymede. Sheâ€™s three tons lighter, not even counting reaction mass consumption. And the transit time is longer than the orbital mechanics projections.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSomeone met her,â€� Miller said. â€œTransferred the gear to another ship.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s your answer,â€� Dawes said. â€œBoth of them. The riot gear was taken off the station by local organized crime. There arenâ€™t records to support it, but I think itâ€™s safe to assume that they also shipped out the personnel to use that gear.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhere to?â€�</p>
      <p>Dawes lifted his hands. Miller nodded. They were off station. Case closed. Another one for the good guys.</p>
      <p>Damn.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve kept my part of our bargain,â€� Dawes said. â€œYou asked for information. Iâ€™ve gotten it. Now, are you going to keep your end?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDrop the Mao investigation,â€� Miller said. It wasnâ€™t a question, and Dawes didnâ€™t act is if it were. Miller leaned back in his chair.</p>
      <p>Juliette Andromeda Mao. Inner system heiress turned OPA courier. Pinnace racer. Brown bcourNow Brown belt, aiming for black.</p>
      <p>â€œSure, what the hell,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s not like I would have shipped her back home if Iâ€™d found her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shifted his hands in a gesture that meant Of course not.</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™s a good kid,â€� Miller said. â€œHow would you feel if you were all grown up and Mommy could still pull you back home by your ear? It was a bullshit job from the start.â€�</p>
      <p>Dawes smiled again. This time it actually did help a little.</p>
