      <h2>Miller sighed, nodded to himself, took off his hat, and...</h2>
      <p>â€œI was just going to put â€™em out an airlock,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>BA834024112 wasnâ€™t much of an asteroid. Barely thirty meters across, it had long ago been surveyed and found completely devoid of useful or valuable minerals. It existed in the registry only to warn ships not to run into it. Julie had left it tethered to wealth measured in the billions when she flew her small shuttle to Eros.</p>
      <p>Up close, the ship that had killed the Scopuli and stolen its crew looked like a shark. It was long and lean and utterly black, almost impossible to see against the backdrop of space with the naked eye. Its radar-deflecting curves gave it an aerodynamic look almost always lacking in space-going vessels. It made Holdenâ€™s skin crawl, but it was beautiful.</p>
      <p>â€œMotherfucker,â€� Amos said under his breath as the crew clustered in the cockpit of the Rocinante to look at it.</p>
      <p>â€œThe Roci doesnâ€™t even see it, Cap,â€� Alex said. â€œIâ€™m pourinâ€™ ladar into it, and all we see is a slightly warmer spot on the asteroid.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLike Becca saw just before the Cant died,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œHer shuttleâ€™s been launched, so Iâ€™m guessinâ€™ this is the right stealth ship someone left tied to a rock,â€� Alex added. â€œCase thereâ€™s more than one.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden tapped his fingers on the back of Alexâ€™s chair for a moment as he floated over the pilotâ€™s head.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s probably full of vomit zombies,â€� Holden finally said.</p>
      <p>â€œWant to go see?â€� said Miller.</p>
      <p>â€œOh yeah,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Chapter Thirty-Four: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The environment suit was better than Miller was used to. Heâ€™d only done a couple walks outside during his years on Ceres, and the Star Helix equipment had been old back then: thick corrugated joints, separable air-supply unit, gloves that left his hands thirty degrees colder than the rest of his body. The Rocinanteâ€™s suits were military and recent, no bulkier than standard riot gear, with integrated life support that could probably keep fingers warm after a hand got shot off. Miller floated, one hand on a strap in the airlock, and flexed his fingers, watching the sharkskin pattern of the knuckle joints.</p>
      <p>It didnâ€™t feel like enough.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right, Alex,â€� Holden said. â€œWeâ€™re in place. Have the Roci knock for us.â€�</p>
      <p>A deep, rumbling vibration shook them. Naomi put a hand against the airlockâ€™s curved wall to steady herself. Amos shifted forward to take point, a reactionless automatic rifle in his hands. When he bent his neck, Miller could hear the vertebrae cracking through his radio. It was the only way he could have heard it; they were already in vacuum.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, Captain,â€� Alex said. â€œIâ€™ve got a seal. The standard security override isnâ€™t working, so give me a secondâ€¦ toâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œProblem?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œGot it. Iâ€™ve got it. We have a connection,â€� Alex said. Then, a moment later: â€œAh. It doesnâ€™t look like thereâ€™s much to breathe over there.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnything?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNope. Hard vacuum,â€� Alex said. â€œBoth her lock doors are open.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAll right, folks,â€� Holden said, â€œkeep an eye on your air supply. Letâ€™s go.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller took a long breath. The external airlock went from soft red to soft green. Holden slid it open, and Amos launched forward, the captain just behind him. Miller gestured to Naomi with a nod. Ladies first.</p>
      <p>The connecting gantry was reinforced, ready to deflect enemy lasers or slow down slugs. Amos landed on the other ship as the hatch to the Rocinante closed behind them. Miller had a momentâ€™s vertigo, the ship before them suddenly clicking from ahead to down in his perception, as if they were falling into something.</p>
      <p>â€œYou all right?â€� Naomi asked.</p>
      <p>Miller nodded, and Amos passed into the other shipâ€™s hatch. One by one, they went in.</p>
      <p>The ship was dead. The lights coming off their environment suits played over the soft, almost streamlined curves of the bulkheads, the cushioned walls, the gray suit lockers. One locker was bent out of shape, like someone or something had forced its way out from within. Amos pushed off slow. Under normal circumstances, hard vacuum would have been assurance enough that nothing was about to jump out at them. Right now, Miller figured it was only even money.</p>
      <p>â€œWhole place is shut down,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œMight be backups in the engine room,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œSo the ass end of the ship from here,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œPretty much.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLetâ€™s be careful,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m heading up to ops,â€� Naomi said. â€œIf thereâ€™s anything running off battery, I canâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, you arenâ€™t,â€� Holden said. â€œWe arenâ€™t splitting up the group until we know what weâ€™re looking at. Stay together.â€�</p>
      <p>Amos moved down, sinking into the darkness. Holden pushed off after him. Miller followed. He couldnâ€™t tell from Naomiâ€™s body language whether she was annoyed or relieved.</p>
      <p>The galley was empty, but signs of struggle showed here and there. A chair with a bent leg. A long, jagged scratch down the wall where something sharp had flaked the paint. Two bullet holes set high along one bulkhead where a shot had gone wide. Miller put a hand out, grabbed one of the tables, and swung slowly.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller?â€� Holden said. â€œAre you coming?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLook at this,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>The dark spill was the color of amber, flaky and shining like glass in his flashlight beam. Holden hovered closer.</p>
      <p>â€œZombie vomit?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œThink so.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWell. I guess weâ€™re on the right ship. For some value of right.â€�</p>
      <p>The crew quarters hung silent and empty. They went through each of them, but there were no personal markingsâ€”no terminals, no pictures, no clues to the names of the men and women who had lived and breathed and presumably died on the ship. Even the captainâ€™s cabin was indicated only by a slightly larger bunk and the face of a locked safe.</p>
      <p>There was a massive central compartment as high and wide as the hull of the Rocinante, the darkness dominated by twelve huge cylinders encrusted with narrow catwalks and scaffolds. Miller saw Naomiâ€™s expressio Millholpression harden.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat are they?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œTorpedo tubes,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œTorpedo tubes?â€� he said. â€œJesus Christ, how many are they packing? A million?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTwelve,â€� she said. â€œJust twelve.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCapital-ship busters,â€� Amos said. â€œBuilt to pretty much kill whatever youâ€™re aiming at with the first shot.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSomething like the Donnager?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>Holden looked back at him, the glow of his heads-up display lighting his features.</p>
      <p>â€œOr the Canterbury,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>The four of them passed between the wide black tubes in silence.</p>
      <p>In the machine and fabrication shops, the signs of violence were more pronounced. There was blood on the floor and walls, along with wide swaths of the glassy gold resin that had once been vomit. A uniform lay in a ball. The cloth had been wadded and soaked in something before the cold of space had frozen it. Habits formed from years of walking through crime scenes put a dozen small things in place: the pattern of scratches on the floor and lift doors, the spatter of blood and vomit, the footprints. They all told the story.</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™re in engineering,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWho?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œThe crew. Whoever was on the ship. All except that one,â€� he said, gesturing at half a footprint that led toward the lift. â€œYou see how her footprints are over the top of everything else. And there, where she stepped in that blood, it was already dry. Flaked instead of smearing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHow you know it was a girl?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œBecause it was Julie,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, whoeverâ€™s in there, theyâ€™ve been sucking vacuum for a long time,â€� Amos said. â€œWant to go see?â€�</p>
      <p>No one said yes, but they all floated forward. The hatch stood open. If the darkness beyond it seemed more solid, more ominous, more personal than the rest of the dead ship had, it was only Millerâ€™s imagination playing tricks. He hesitated, trying to summon up the image of Julie, but she wouldnâ€™t come.</p>
      <p>Floating into the engineering deck was like swimming into a cave. Miller saw the other flashlights playing over walls and panels, looking for live controls, or else controls that could come alive. He aimed his own beam into the body of the room, the dark swallowing it.</p>
      <p>â€œWe got batteries, Capâ€™n,â€� Amos said. â€œAndâ€¦ looks like the reactor got shut down. Intentional.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThink you can get it back up?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWant to run some diagnostics,â€� Amos said. â€œThere could be a reason they shut it off, and I donâ€™t want to find out the hard way.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood point.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBut I can at least get usâ€¦ someâ€¦ come on, you bastard.â€�</p>
      <p>All around the deck, blue-white lights flared up. The sudden brilliance blinded Miller for a half second. His vision returned with a sense of growing confusion. Naomi gasped, and Holden yelped. Something in the back of Millerâ€™s own mind started to shriek, and he forced it into silence. It was just a crime scene. They were only ba cri. H only bodies.</p>
      <p>Except they werenâ€™t.</p>
      <p>The reactor stood before him, quiescent and dead. All around it, a layer of human flesh. He could pick out arms, hands with fingers splayed so wide they hurt to look at. The long snake of a spine curved, ribs fanning out like the legs of some perverse insect. He tried to make what he was seeing make sense. Heâ€™d seen men eviscerated before. He knew that the long, ropy swirl to the left of the thing were intestines. He could see where the small bowel widened to become a colon. The familiar shape of a skull looked out at him.</p>
      <p>But then, among the familiar anatomy of death and dismemberment, there were other things: nautilus spirals, wide swaths of soft black filament, a pale expanse of something that might have been skin cut by a dozen gill-like vents, a half-formed limb that looked equally like an insect and a fetus without being either one. The frozen, dead flesh surrounded the reactor like the skin of an orange. The crew of the stealth ship. Maybe of the Scopuli as well.</p>
      <p>All but Julie.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Amos said. â€œThis could take a little longer than I was thinking, Cap.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s okay,â€� Holden said. His voice on the radio sounded shaky. â€œYou donâ€™t have to.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s no trouble. As long as none of that freaky shit broke the containment, reactor should boot up just fine.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t mind being aroundâ€¦ it?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œHonest, Capâ€™n, Iâ€™m not thinking about it. Give me twenty minutes, Iâ€™ll tell you if we got power or if we have to patch a line over from the Roci.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden said. And then again, his voice more solid: â€œOkay, but donâ€™t touch any of that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWasnâ€™t going to,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>They floated back out through the hatch, Holden and Naomi and Miller coming last.</p>
      <p>â€œIs thatâ€¦ â€� Naomi said, then coughed and started again. â€œIs that whatâ€™s happening on Eros?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œProbably,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œAmos,â€� Holden said. â€œDo you have enough battery power to light up the computers?â€�</p>
      <p>There was a pause. Miller took a deep breath, the plastic-and-ozone scent of the suitâ€™s air system filling his nose.</p>
      <p>â€œI think so,â€� Amos said dubiously. â€œBut if we can get the reactor up firstâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBring up the computers.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re the captain, Capâ€™n,â€� Amos said. â€œHave it to you in five.â€�</p>
      <p>In silence, they floated upâ€”backâ€”to the airlock, and past it to the operations deck. Miller hung back, watching the way Holdenâ€™s trajectory kept him near Naomi and then away from her.</p>
      <p>Protective and head-shy both, Miller thought. Bad combination.</p>
      <p>Julie was waiting in the airlock. Not at first, of course. Miller slid back into the space, his mind churning through everything heâ€™d seen, just like it was a case. A normal case. His gaze drifted toward the broken locker. There was no suit in it. For a moment, he was back on Eros, in the apartment where Julie had died. There had been an environment suit there. And then Julie was there with him, pushing her way out of the locker.</p>
      <p>What were you doing there? he thought.</p>
      <p>â€œNo brig,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œI just noticed,â€� Miller said. â€œShipâ€™s got no brig. They arenâ€™t built to carry prisoners.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden made a low agreeing grunt.</p>
      <p>â€œMakes you wonder what they were planning to do with the crew of the Scopuli,â€� Naomi said. The tone of her voice meant she didnâ€™t wonder at all.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t think they were,â€� Miller said slowly. â€œThis whole thingâ€¦ they were improvising.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œImprovising?â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œShip was carrying an infectious something or other without enough containment to contain it. Taking on prisoners without a brig to hold â€™em in. They were making this up as they went along.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOr they had to hurry,â€� Holden said. â€œSomething happened that made them hurry. But what they did on Eros must have taken months to arrange. Maybe years. So maybe something happened at the last minute?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBe interesting to know what,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Compared to the rest of the ship, the ops deck looked peaceful. Normal. The computers had finished their diagnostics, screens glowing placidly. Naomi went to one, holding the back of the chair with one hand so the gentle touch of her fingers against the screen wouldnâ€™t push her backward.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll do what I can here,â€� she said. â€œYou can check the bridge.â€�</p>
      <p>There was a pause that carried weight.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll be fine,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right. I know youâ€™llâ€¦ Iâ€¦ Câ€™mon, Miller.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller let the captain float ahead into the bridge. The screens there were spooling through diagnostics so standard Miller recognized them. It was a wider space than heâ€™d imagined, with five stations with crash couches customized for other peopleâ€™s bodies. Holden strapped in at one. Miller took a slow turn around the deck. Nothing seemed out of place hereâ€”no blood, no broken chairs or torn padding. When it happened, the fight had been down near the reactor. He wasnâ€™t sure yet what that meant. He sat at what, under a standard layout, would have been the security station, and opened a private channel to Holden.</p>
      <p>â€œAnything youâ€™re looking for in particular?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBriefings. Overviews,â€� Holden said shortly. â€œWhateverâ€™s useful. You?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSee if I can get into the internal monitors.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHoping to findâ€¦?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat Julie found,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>The security assumed that anyone sitting at the console had access to the low-level feeds. It still took half an hour to parse the command structure and query interface. Once Miller had that down, it wasnâ€™t hard. The time stamp on the log listed the feed as the day the Scopuli had gone missing. The security camera in the airlock bay showed the crewâ€”Belters, most of themâ€”being escorted in. Their captors were in armor, with faceplates lowered. Miller wondered if theyâ€™d meant to keep their identities secret. That would almost have suggested they were planning to keep the crew alive. Or maybe they were just wary of some last-minute resistance. The crew of the Scopuli werenâ€™t wearingi>Sco™t wearing environment suits or armor. A couple of them werenâ€™t even wearing uniforms.</p>
      <p>But Julie was.</p>
      <p>It was strange, watching her move. With a sense of dislocation, Miller realized that heâ€™d never actually seen her in motion. All the pictures heâ€™d had in his file back on Ceres had been stills. Now here she was, floating with her chosen compatriots, her hair back out of her eyes, her jaw clamped. She looked very small surrounded by her crew and the men in armor. The little rich girl whoâ€™d turned her back on wealth and status to be with the downtrodden Belt. The girl whoâ€™d told her mother to sell the Razorbackâ€”the ship sheâ€™d lovedâ€”rather than give in to emotional blackmail. In motion, she looked a little different from the imaginary version heâ€™d built of herâ€”the way she pulled her shoulders back, the habit of reaching her toes toward the floor even in null gâ€”but the basic image was the same. He felt like he was filling in blanks with the new details rather than reimagining the woman.</p>
      <p>The guards said somethingâ€”the security feedâ€™s audio was playing to vacuumâ€”and the Scopuli crew looked aghast. Then, hesitantly, the captain started taking his uniform off. They were stripping the prisoners. Miller shook his head.</p>
      <p>â€œBad plan.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œNothing. Sorry.â€�</p>
      <p>Julie wasnâ€™t moving. One of the guards moved toward her, his legs braced on the wall. Julie, whoâ€™d lived through being raped, maybe, or something as bad. Whoâ€™d studied jiu jitsu to feel safe afterward. Maybe they thought she was just being modest. Maybe they were afraid she was hiding a weapon under her clothes. Either way, they tried to force the point. One of the guards pushed her, and she latched on to his arm like her life depended on it. Miller winced when he saw the manâ€™s elbow bend the wrong way, but he also smiled.</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s my girl, he thought. Give â€™em hell.</p>
      <p>And she did. For almost forty seconds, the airlock bay was a battleground. Even some of the cowed Scopuli crew tried to join in. But then Julie didnâ€™t see a thick-shouldered man launch from behind her. Miller felt it when the gauntleted hand hammered Julieâ€™s temple. She wasnâ€™t out, but she was groggy. The men with guns stripped her with a cold efficiency, and when there were no weapons or comm devices, they handed her a jumpsuit and shoved her in a locker. The others, they led down into the ship. Miller matched time stamps and switched feeds.</p>
      <p>The prisoners were taken to the galley, then bound to the tables. One of the guards spent a minute or so talking, but with his faceplate down, the only clues Miller had to the content of the sermon were the reactions of the crewâ€”wide-eyed disbelief, confusion, outrage, and fear. The guard could have been saying anything.</p>
      <p>Miller started skipping. A few hours, then a few more. The ship was under thrust, the prisoners actually sitting at the tables instead of floating near them. He flipped to other parts of the ship. Julieâ€™s locker was still closed. If he hadnâ€™t known better, heâ€™d have assumed she was dead.</p>
      <p>He skipped ahead.</p>
      <p>One hundred and thirty-two hours later, the crew of the Scopuli grew a pair. Miller saw it in their bodies even before the violence started. Heâ€™d seen holding cells rise up before, and the prisoners had the same sullen-but-excited look. The feed showed the stretch of wall where heâ€™d seen the bullet holes. They werenâ€™t there yet. They would be. A mantherency. A man came into the picture with a tray of food rations.</p>
      <p>Here it comes, Miller thought.</p>
      <p>The fight was short and brutal. The prisoners didnâ€™t stand a chance. Miller watched as they hauled one of themâ€”a sandy-haired manâ€”to the airlock and spaced him. The others were put in heavy restraints. Some wept. Some screamed. Miller skipped ahead.</p>
      <p>It had to be in there someplace. The moment when itâ€”whatever it wasâ€”got loose. But either it had happened in some unmonitored crew quarters or it had been there from the beginning. Almost exactly one hundred and sixty hours after Julie had gone into the locker, a man in a white jumper, eyes glassy and stance unsure, lurched out of the crew quarters and vomited on one of the guards.</p>
      <p>â€œFuck!â€� Amos shouted.</p>
      <p>Miller was out of his chair before he knew what had happened. Holden was up too.</p>
      <p>â€œAmos?â€� Holden said. â€œTalk to me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHold on,â€� Amos said. â€œYeah, itâ€™s okay, Capâ€™n. Itâ€™s just these fuckers stripped off a bunch of the reactor shielding. Weâ€™ve got her up, but I sucked down a few more rads than Iâ€™d have picked.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGet back to the Roci,â€� Holden said. Miller steadied himself against a wall, pushing back down toward the control stations.</p>
      <p>â€œNo offense, sir, but it ainâ€™t like Iâ€™m about to start pissing blood or anything fun like that,â€� Amos said. â€œI got surprised more than anything. I start feeling itchy, Iâ€™ll head back over, but I can get some atmosphere for us by working out of the machine shop if you give me a few more minutes.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller watched Holdenâ€™s face as the man struggled. He could make it an order; he could leave it be.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, Amos. But you start getting light-headed or anythingâ€”I mean anythingâ€”and you get over to the sick bay.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAye, aye,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex, keep an eye on Amosâ€™ biomed feed from over there. Give us a heads-up if you see a problem,â€� Holden said on the general channel.</p>
      <p>â€œRoger,â€� came Alexâ€™s lazy drawl.</p>
      <p>â€œYou finding anything?â€� Holden asked Miller on their private channel.</p>
      <p>â€œNothing unexpected,â€� Miller said. â€œYou?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, actually. Take a look.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller pushed himself to the screen Holden had been working. Holden pulled himself back into the station and started pulling up feeds.</p>
      <p>â€œI was thinking that someone had to go last,â€� Holden said. â€œI mean, there had to be someone who was the least sick when whatever it was got loose. So I went through the directory to see what activity was going on before the system went dead.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s a whole bunch of activity that looks like it happened a couple days before the system shutdown, and then nothing for two solid days. And then a little spike. A lot of accessed files and system diagnostics. Then someone hacked the override codes to blow atmosphere.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt was Julie, then.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s what I was thinking,â€� Holden said. â€œBut one of the feeds she accessed wasâ€¦ Shit, where is it? It was rightâ€¦ Oh. Here. Watch this.â€�</p>
      <p>The screen blinked, controls dropping to standby, and a high-res emblem, green and gold, came up. The corporate logo of Protogen, with a slogan Miller hadnâ€™t seen before. First. Fastest. Furthest.</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™s the time stamp on the file?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œThe original was created about two years ago,â€� Holden said. â€œThis copy was burned eight months ago.â€�</p>
      <p>The emblem faded, and a pleasant-faced man sitting at a desk took its place. He had dark hair, with just a scattering of gray at the temples, and lips that seemed used to smiling. He nodded at the camera. The smile didnâ€™t reach his eyes, which were as empty as a sharkâ€™s.</p>
      <p>Sociopath, Miller thought.</p>
      <p>The manâ€™s lips began moving soundlessly. Holden said, â€œShit,â€� and hit a switch to have the audio transmitted to their suits. He rewound the video feed and started it over.</p>
      <p>â€œMr. Dresden,â€� the man said. â€œI would like to thank you and the members of the board for taking the time to review this information. Your support, both financial and otherwise, has been absolutely essential to the incredible discoveries weâ€™ve seen on this project. While my team has been point man, as it were, Protogenâ€™s tireless commitment to the advancement of science has made our work possible.</p>
      <p>â€œGentlemen, I will be frank. The Phoebe protomolecule has exceeded all our expectations. I believe it represents a genuinely game-changing technological breakthrough. I know that these kinds of corporate presentations are prone to hyperbole. Please understand that I have thought about this carefully and chosen my words: Protogen can become the most important and powerful entity in the history of the human race. But it will require initiative, ambition, and bold action.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHeâ€™s talking about killing people,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve seen this already?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Miller shook his head. The feed changed. The man faded out, and an animation took his place. A graphic representation of the solar system. Orbits marked in wide swaths of color showed the plane of the ecliptic. The virtual camera swirled out from the inner planets, where Mr. Dresden and board members presumably were, and out toward the gas giants.</p>
      <p>â€œFor those of you on the board unfamiliar with the project, eight years ago, the first manned landing was made on Phoebe,â€� the sociopath said.</p>
      <p>The animation zoomed in toward Saturn, rings and planet flying past in a triumph of graphic design over accuracy.</p>
      <p>â€œA small ice moon, the assumption was that Phoebe would eventually be mined for water, much like the rings themselves. The Martian government commissioned a scientific survey more out of a sense of bureaucratic completeness than from expectation of economic gain. Core samples were taken, and when silicate anomalies raised flags, Protogen was approached as cosponsor of a long-term research facility.â€�</p>
      <p>The moon itselfâ€”Phoebeâ€”filled the frame, turning slowly to show all sides like a prostitute at a cheap brothel. It was a crater-marked lump, indistinguishable from a thousand other asteroids and planetesimals Miller had seen.</p>
      <p>â€œGiven Phoebeâ€™s extra-ecliptical orbit,â€� the sociopath went on, â€œone theory has been that it was a body that originated in the Kuiper belt and had been captured by Saturn when it happened to pass through the solar system. The existence of complex silicon stexist="0icon structures within the interior ice, along with suggestions of impact-resistant structures within the architecture of the body itself, have forced us to reevaluate this.</p>
      <p>â€œUsing analyses proprietary to Protogen and not yet shared with the Martian team, we have determined beyond any credible doubt that what you are seeing now is not a naturally formed planetesimal, but a weapon. Specifically, a weapon designed to carry its payload through the depths of interplanetary space and deliver it safely onto Earth two and one third billion years ago, when life itself was in its earliest stages. And the payload, gentlemen, is this.â€�</p>
      <p>The display clicked to a graphic that Miller couldnâ€™t quite parse. It looked like the medical text of a virus, but with wide, looping structures that were at once beautiful and improbable.</p>
      <p>â€œThe protomolecule first caught our interest for its ability to maintain its primary structure in a wide variety of conditions through secondary and tertiary changes. It also showed an affinity for carbon and silicon structures. Its activity suggested it was not in itself a living thing, but a set of free-floating instructions designed to adapt to and guide other replicating systems. Animal experiments suggest that its effects are not exclusive to simple replicators, but are, in fact, scalable.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnimal tests,â€� Miller said. â€œWhat, they dumped it on a cat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe initial implication of this,â€� the sociopath went on, â€œis that a larger biosphere exists, of which our solar system is only a part, and that the protomolecule is an artifact of that environment. That alone, I think you must agree, would revolutionize human understanding of the universe. Let me assure you, itâ€™s small beer. If accidents of orbital mechanics had not captured Phoebe, life as we know it would not presently exist. But something else would. The earliest cellular life on Earth would have been hijacked. Reprogrammed along lines contained within the structure of the protomolecule.â€�</p>
      <p>The sociopath reappeared. For the first time, smile lines appeared around his eyes, like a parody of themselves. Miller felt a visceral hatred growing in his gut and knew himself well enough to recognize it for what it was. Fear.</p>
      <p>â€œProtogen is in a position to take sole possession of not only the first technology of genuinely extraterrestrial origin, but also a prefabricated mechanism for the manipulation of living systems and the first clues as to the nature of the largerâ€”I will call it galacticâ€”biosphere. Directed by human hands, the applications of this are limitless. I believe that the opportunity now facing not only us but life itself is as profound and transformative as anything that has ever happened. And, further, the control of this technology will represent the base of all political and economic power from now on.</p>
