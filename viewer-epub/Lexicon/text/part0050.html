			<p class="x03-Chapter-Number">[TWO]</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">She caught the train to Blacktown and wandered the streets until she found the Army Disposals store she’d read about the previous day. It was big, almost a warehouse, its aisles packed with quasi- and wannabe-military gear, camo netting hung across the ceiling. She squeezed between bikers and bushies and young men with large, clearly defined chips on large, clearly defined shoulders, occasionally picking up a bottle or knife or pack that seemed interesting. In aisle three, a bearded man in jeans and a light T-shirt approached her and offered assistance.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” Emily said. “I’m looking for a camouflage tarpaulin that can be made into a tent.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Desert or bush?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Desert,” she said, pleased to have skipped the <em class="calibre1">oh-ho-and-what-do-you-need-that-for</em>s.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have tarps and we have camo netting. You can throw one over the other.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I want a single product, if there is one.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’ll be carrying it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” she said. “Exactly.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then may I recommend a space bag?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A lightweight sleeping bag, foil interior, waterproof canvas exterior. Little mesh part on the face you can open for ventilation without letting in the bugs. Folds up to nothing. Very new. Hard to acquire, as they’re still in service.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How hard?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Two thousand dollars.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She nodded. That she could do. “It’s camouflage?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s not. But I tell you what, if that’s what you desire, I will sew some camo onto it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes!” she said. “That would be terrific.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He led her to a counter and processed her deposit. “Call you in two days. Anything else I can help you with?” He saw her hesitation. “If you’re planning to spend any time in the desert, I hope you have a water system.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Water isn’t a problem. But I have a concern about snakes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Rightly so.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What can I do to keep them away?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The general idea is to keep away from them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have good boots. But . . .” She gestured. “Is there some kind of electronic device that scares them? Like the ones that keep insects out of your house?” The man had begun to look amused, so she guessed no. “Anything?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He scratched his beard. “You can watch where you put your feet.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hmm,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And take a stick,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">So she was not thrilled with the snake situation, but otherwise things were coming together. The space bag was the final piece in the puzzle; with that, she could begin testing. Which was tempting to skip, but she had uncovered some alarming numbers about sweat-related water loss in the desert, and this wasn’t something she wanted to confirm forty miles from the nearest living human being. Nearest <em class="calibre1">benign</em> human being, that was, since she was working under the assumption that Broken Hill was surrounded by proles, men and women who worked in bakeries or gas stations or drove trucks or simply stood at key intersections and would, upon seeing her, become very focused and intent and proceed directly to a phone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Hence the need for a desert crossing. A few months before, when she’d been coming for Harry, she’d done it on a dirt bike. In retrospect, it seemed wildly risky. But she’d been impatient. She had hurried for him. And it had ended so badly. She didn’t want to think about that. This time there would be caution. There would be thirty miles of desert traversed by foot, and no one would see her coming because what she was doing was unimaginable.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once she had the word, she would begin the next stage of her journey, to DC. When she got there, she would rip out Yeats’s heart, just like he had torn out hers. What happened after that didn’t matter.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She spent a lot of time on trains, reading dictionaries. She wore a hoodie and pulled it down, in case of cameras. She could ride all day for two dollars and never be in the same spot for more than a few minutes. The last service was around two, so then she had to find a place to sleep, but that wasn’t hard. She had done that before.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sometimes she nodded off on the train. She tried not to, because she feared waking up to poets moving through the carriage, no way out, but it was kind of unavoidable. The dictionaries were not very interesting. So when she felt her head drifting toward the glass, the factories or fields passing by outside, she let it happen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The day after she ordered her space blanket, she drifted awake to find a man sitting opposite, watching her. She was half out of her seat, words forming on her lips, before she realized he wasn’t Eliot. He wasn’t anybody. She sank back into her seat. Her head was full of terror; it always was, coming out of dreams.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sorry,” said the man. “Didn’t mean to startle you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s okay.” She was getting her bearings. The man was about forty, nicely dressed, sweater, a good watch. She talked to such people sometimes, as a precursor to persuading them to give her money.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s a lot of books. Dictionaries?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She nodded.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you a student?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Of life,” she said. People liked this kind of quippery. It caused them to open up. “I just read them for fun.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Dictionaries?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That doesn’t sound like fun. That sounds awful.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Awful</em> used to mean ‘full of awe.’ The same meaning as <em class="calibre1">awesome</em>. I learned that from a dictionary.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He blinked.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“See?” she said. “Fun.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That is actually fascinating. What else?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She looked at her notes. She had notes. “<em class="calibre1">Cause</em> has changed. The definition used to be ‘to make something happen.’ Now they’ve added, ‘especially something bad.’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’ve changed <em class="calibre1">cause</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’ve noticed a change. Dictionaries record common usage.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I thought it was a panel of professors,” said the man, “at a university somewhere, deciding what words mean.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So it’s bad to cause something now?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. And to join causes, probably. Because of semantic leakage.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” he said. “You are the most interesting person I’ve met all week.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thanks,” she said, but she was getting a bad feeling. She was regretting this conversation. “My stop is coming up.” She packed her dictionaries into her bag.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you have somewhere to sleep tonight?” She didn’t say anything. “I’m sorry, that didn’t come out right. I mean, are you okay? You don’t look okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m sitting close enough to smell you.” His expression looked genuine but she didn’t like his eyes. There were a lot of tiny muscles there and they were not consistent with the rest of his face. “Is there any way I can help you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thanks, but no.” She stood up. “This is my stop.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Mine, too.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She sat. “My mistake.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He leaned forward. He did this slowly, like he wanted to get it right. “Do you need money?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She hesitated, because she did need money. But not from this guy. She didn’t even want to compromise him. She just needed to get away. Her eye was starting to hurt.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Whatever trouble you’re in, I can help. I’m a lawyer. I have money. No strings. I see an intelligent young woman who needs a helping hand. That’s all. Say no and I won’t bother you anymore.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The train stopped. The carriage was almost empty, the platform bare. She waited until she was sure the man wasn’t moving, then stood and walked quickly to the doors. She got there in time, hit the button, stepped off, and kept walking. A night breeze stirred her hair. She wanted to look around but kept her head down, in case of cameras.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Five hundred dollars,” said the man, right behind her. “Look at it.” She ignored him. “Are you stupid? Just take it. <em class="calibre1">Take it.</em>” He put a hand on her shoulder.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She turned and shoved him. He staggered backward. He really was holding a fistful of cash. Behind him, the train began to pull out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m trying to help you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck off!” she shouted. And she went after him, for some reason, and pushed him again. “Leave me alone!” He tried to catch her arm. But she was too quick for that. Whatever else he was, he wasn’t prepared for someone who fought back. She shoved him again. “<em class="calibre1">Leave me alone!</em>” His back hit the moving train and he rebounded a step onto the platform. Her brain was full of violence and her star was singing and another push could send him between the carriages. If she timed it right. She thought, <em class="calibre1">Yeats, Yeats, save it for Yeats.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jesus,” said the man. “Jesus.” He got around her and ran away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stood there, breathing. She needed to get out of here. She had to leave before the cops arrived. She made for the exit, her hoodie pulled tight. She couldn’t wait for the space bag. She would have to call and have it mailed. She had to take herself out of the cities, away from people, before someone got hurt.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">A month later, she was trudging across the desert. She had a stick. It was night, because during the day you could see for twenty miles in all directions, and she assumed someone would be looking. Also snakes slept at night. She wore a fur-lined parka and loose shorts, maybe an odd combination, but the thing was the nights were cold enough to freeze exposed sweat. A twenty-eight-pound backpack was strapped around her waist and shoulders. She was loving her boots: big, brown, comfortable shit-kickers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She made good ground on night one and stopped at the first hint of dawn. She found a depression in the dirt beside three scrubby trees, a long-dead waterhole, and spread her space bag beneath them. She sat on it awhile, cooling, watching the stars retreat and the sky lighten. Her body felt satisfyingly used. Not exhausted. She was in good shape. She ate a hard biscuit and crawled beneath the space bag and fell asleep.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She woke a few hours later in a furnace. She was swimming in sweat. She peeked out, thinking maybe she’d lost her shade. But no. It was just hot. She wriggled out, keeping flat to the ground to avoid presenting a profile, and unzipped her backpack. She pulled out four wooden stakes and used them to suspend the space bag a few feet above the ground. The idea was to remain camouflaged from above while allowing air to move around her. She stripped naked, crawled under the sheet, sucked water from her drinking tube, and tried to sleep.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The second night was harder. Her legs felt suspiciously sore, which they hadn’t during her trials. She might have been pushing herself, walking faster than she needed to. She was blowing her water budget, too. She forced herself to slow down, stop for more rests, but then worried that she was falling behind on distance, which would create new water problems. The chances were excellent that she could source fresh water in Broken Hill, in which case she had no problem. But she did not want to rely on this, since if she was wrong she would die. She kept walking, her stick ready, in case of night snakes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She made less ground than she wanted and stopped early, feeling dizzy. She drank a lot, even splashing some on her face. She ate more biscuits. She hadn’t brought many of those, to avoid temptation, because digestion increased the body’s demand for water. That was starting to seem like a mistake. She crawled under the space bag.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Again, she was woken by the sun baking the earth and had to convert the bag to a little tent. This time, however, she realized the trees she’d camped beneath were basically leafless, which was a serious problem, because no shade. There was no wind and the underside of the space bag radiated heat. She lay there as long as she could, watching her skin turn mottled pink then red, and crawled out and curled against the trunk of a tree. It was better but only a little. She began to seriously wonder if she would die. Two weeks ago, she had decided against bringing the long white Bedouin robes that would have made it possible to walk in the daytime without passing out, thinking they weren’t worth the weight. This decision might kill her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She drank her electrolytes. Every thirty minutes, she tipped tiny amounts of water onto her hands and wiped them across her face and neck. The water pack grew scarily thin but it was either drink or expire. In late afternoon, a light breeze began to shift the sand and she cried a little despite the fluid loss.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Finally the sun eased toward the earth. Sometime after that, she began to feel human. She got to her feet and began to pack her bag and thought about which direction to go. The smart thing was to head back. It would take two nights but she had enough water and would be able to recover and rethink how she was going to do this. But it would mean starting over. And the town was only one more night away. It would probably have water. Even if the tanks had gone bad, there would be bottles. Stores and cafés with darkened refrigerators. She ignored the part of her that asked <em class="calibre1">but what if </em>and started walking.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Her feet became sore, then wet-feeling, then numb. She didn’t want to blame the boots but she had the feeling they were letting her down. They were like boys who at first were cool and suave and then after a couple of weeks you realized were assholes. Around midnight she began to hallucinate a little and forget important things like checking her compass. She came across a boulder and sat on it and woke up face-first in the sand. Her lips felt like a baked cake. She drank and drank and finished her water.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The town rose with the dawn. She walked toward it. She lost her stick somehow. She began to pass houses, places she recognized. She saw the first body and tried not to look but her eyes wouldn’t stay still. It was a woman she knew. Cheryl. She recognized the dress. <em class="calibre1">I’m here to fix it</em>, she told Cheryl. <em class="calibre1">To say sorry.</em> But she couldn’t really believe Cheryl would be pleased by that, or would forgive Emily in any way. She sucked on her water tube and remembered it was empty and turned in at a gate because it was time to search for water. She walked up the path and stopped because on the house’s concrete front steps lay a brown snake, sunning itself. She stared at it. “Fuck off!” she shouted, and stamped her boots, and it wriggled away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She pulled open cupboards and passed out in a bedroom and threw up in a toilet and wasn’t sure in which order that happened. She found water and slept. When she awoke the sun was throwing shadows at forty-five degrees and she had to stare at them a long time to figure out whether it was morning or afternoon. She had slept for a day and a half. She was ravenous.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She found and devoured a box of fruit bars. Her brain liked this and she began to be able to make sense of things. Empty water bottles were everywhere. She sat at the wooden kitchen table and waited for the sun to go down. Then she strapped herself into her pack.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A strong wind was blowing, tossing stinging sand at her face. She hiked along the road. She had steeled herself for the bodies, and kept her eyes up and her mind focused, but the closer she got, the more the wild, clawing terror grew inside her, wanting to turn her around and steer her out of here. Sand stung her eye and she rubbed at it but it made no difference.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She passed the gas station, with its burned cars and trucks. She made herself machinery: legs and feet and purpose. She reached the hospital. She stepped over a snarl of cloth and leather and gleaming bone and pushed open the side door. These were things she did. She walked down the corridor. She didn’t recognize anything because that part of her brain was closed. She reached the double doors for the emergency room and dropped her pack and closed her eyes. Then she went in.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The smell was very bad. Old but wrong. Her nose began to run. Her boots hit something and she shuffled around it. When anything blocked her path, she carefully stepped over it. Her fingers found the counter. She followed it along to the place where she had left the bareword.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It wasn’t there. She stood awhile, breathing. She followed the counter all the way to the wall, sweeping its surfaces. Her fingers found objects, small things she could identify like a stapler and a nameplate and larger things she dropped upon ascertaining they were not what she wanted and did not think about. She reached the wall and began making a low sound, equal parts moan and hum.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She circled the counter twice. She made her way back to where the bareword had been and dropped to her hands and knees and began to feel around on the floor. Almost immediately she found cloth and hair and her hum became a shriek and she couldn’t do it anymore. She couldn’t grope around corpses. She got to her feet. The idea crept into her brain: <em class="calibre1">I’m lost</em>. She would never find her way out. She would spend the rest of her life crawling over the bodies of the people she’d let die, searching for an exit she was too afraid to open her eyes and look for. Her breaths came in hitching shrieks. She tripped twice and then her hands found the doors and she crawled through them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She returned to the house. She could have sought out Harry’s but wasn’t up to facing more memories. With four walls around her, she felt safer. She scrubbed her hands in a toilet cistern. She sat on the seat and stared at nothing. She felt numb. The word should have been there.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats had probably wanted to put her in exactly this position. He had probably recovered the word months ago, in secret. She had been tracked all the way in, and right now they were moving through the streets, corralling her, whispering to each other guttural words.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But this did not seem right. She did not understand Yeats well, but in her experience, people with power used it. She felt the word was there. She felt that strongly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After a while, a thought occurred to her. She rose from the seat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She went back to the hospital and through the corridors to the emergency room doors. She put her pack against the wall and withdrew a digital camera, which she had found at the house. She had tested its batteries already but took a photo of a fire extinguisher, just to be sure. Then she closed her eyes and pushed through the doors.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shuffled inside a few steps and raised the camera. Her idea was that this thing really was a word. It was on petrified wood, but the wood wasn’t the important part. The important part was the mark. She pressed the shutter button and felt the flash on the inside of her eyelids. She shifted her aim and pressed again. She would accumulate photos. Most of the photos would contain unbearable things, but in one would be the word. People kept coming into this room and turning into killers, ergo the word was somewhere it could be seen. She adjusted her aim, pressed the shutter for another photo. She would keep taking them until the camera ran out of room. Then she would download the photos to a computer. She would magnify them a thousand times and inspect each picture a handful of pixels at a time. It would take forever. She would see awful things. But she would do it. Eventually, she would find the edges of something that looked like wood. She would know where in the image the bareword was located. She could magnify it a hundred times, until it was too big to see all at once. And she could copy it. The word was not a thing. It was information. It could be duplicated. She could copy it one piece at a time, carve it onto wood so it would be just the same. Maybe she’d get someone to help, so she’d never hold the whole thing in her brain. Then she’d have a hundred tiny pieces, numbered on the back, which she could reassemble. She would have to find a way to carry it safely. To keep it always close. She pressed the shutter again. She was thinking maybe a necklace.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She came out of the hospital. The air felt incredibly fresh and she gulped at it. She started walking, then running, her pack bouncing on her back. She was clutching the camera. She should stop and seal it in plastic, stash it away safely. But she couldn’t stop. She ran through dead streets and a crow cawed and she shrieked back at it, an insane yodel that wouldn’t stay quiet. She was supposed to be stealthy. They could be listening. She ran, hiccupping and gibbering, desperate to put distance between her and this place, to reach somewhere she could open her lungs and scream triumph like she wanted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Yeats trotted up the mansion steps and was set upon by butlers. He’d thought he had lost them at the foot of the stairs, but there were more. One attempted to steer him through the great open double doors and another began gently inquiring if he required refreshment and a third wanted to take his coat. All this was conducted in a low-register butler octave, making Yeats feel as if he was moving through a burbling stream. He allowed himself to be de-coated. A fourth butler seized the opportunity to step forward and brazenly adjust his bow tie. The butler who wanted to infuse Yeats with refreshments positioned himself so that Yeats need only take a step forward for a champagne flute to slide effortlessly into his left hand, but Yeats didn’t know this butler, and in no fucking universe did he allow strangers to insert fluids into his body.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s Spanish,” said Eliot. He had followed Yeats up the steps and was peering into the house. Butlers navigated around Eliot as if he were a rocky prow in a seething ocean, because he was not wearing a tuxedo. He was in a brown suit and beige coat, which apparently Yeats would need to physically pry from his body if he ever wanted to see Eliot in anything else. There was a code, of course. The organization imposed a ceiling on the quality of dress a poet was permitted to enjoy, commensurate with the poet’s level. The point was to address the situation whereby a newly graduated poet realized there was very little in the world denied to him and began to get about in outrageous suits and three hundred thousand dollar cars, drawing attention. And technically the code applied to Yeats. Technically, his entire ensemble should have cost roughly half the price of his current shoes. But Yeats did not follow the code, because he was not a twenty-year-old idiot who required protection from temptation. He was intelligent enough to respect the intent of the code without slavishly adhering to its letter. Eliot, however. Eliot in his last-century suit, his repulsive department store shoes, his wrinkled coat. The most important thing about Eliot was that he wouldn’t break a rule to save his life.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you coming in?” Yeats said. “I believe that some of the delegates have brought advisers.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. I’m not dressed for it,” Eliot said, then realized it wasn’t a real invitation.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then I will see you at the office.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Russian’s not coming. That’s what I came to tell you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Yeats hesitated. The butler with the champagne flute took the opportunity to slide forward and Yeats glanced at him, bestowing upon the butler the terrible shame of having drawn notice. The butler fell away, mortified. “What do you mean?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Russian’s doing it via speakerphone.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You must be joking.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot shrugged. “It’s what his people have said.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” Yeats said. He prepared for these meetings carefully. He attempted to consider every eventuality. But a <em class="calibre1">speakerphone</em>? Was Russian that afraid of compromise? Was he not aware that employing a <em class="calibre1">speakerphone</em> would broadcast his fear, screaming his vulnerability to every delegate in this house? It was ridiculous.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot was still hanging around, eyeing the swirling gowns and tuxedos inside the room. “Thank you,” Yeats said. Eliot nodded and began to trot down the steps. Yeats felt his mood lifting with each step Eliot took, with each increment of distance added between him and those shoes. Butlers began to swarm, excited by his inattention. Yeats shrugged them off and entered the house.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Just inside the doors was von Goethe, regaling a glittering circle that included, if Yeats was not mistaken, one senator and two congressmen. Goethe was German, short and sharp-nosed with dark, slicked-back hair. He was wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, which Yeats was sure were decorative. His shoes were fine brown soles. Goethe excused himself from the group and clasped Yeats’s hands in both of his. “<em class="calibre1">Guten Tag, mein Freund</em>,” said Yeats, which caused Goethe’s face to crumple in disgust. “<em class="calibre1">Wie geht es Ihnen?”</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Rather nauseous, after that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I apologize,” said Yeats. “I do not have the opportunity to practice my German as often as I would like.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You are forgiven.” This exchange established that Goethe didn’t wish to engage Yeats in German, which was sensible, since it was easier to resist compromise in a learned language than a native one, but cowardly, for the same reason. Yeats was happy to roll with it, in the spirit of the occasion. He wasn’t here to compromise anyone. Also, he sincerely doubted Goethe was capable of troubling him in English. “A fine occasion you have arranged. So worthy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” said Yeats. For the first time he took in the stage, the tables draped in white cloth, the tasteful sign by the podium that declared: <span class="SCAP1">A WORLD OF LITERACY</span>. “We do what we can.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I was speaking with one of your politicians and he informed me that your government is investing some hundreds of millions of dollars to teach children across Asia to read.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We do what we can.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Read <em class="calibre1">English</em>,” said Goethe.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” he said. “You can hardly expect us to teach them German.” He clasped the hand of a tall, bronze-skinned woman who had met his eye across the ballroom twenty seconds ago and begun to cross it like a torpedo. “Rosalía, what a pleasure.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“William,” she said. “I swear, you age backward.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“De Castro,” said Goethe, casting an eye over her green gown, which was daring when she stood still and practically scandalous when she moved. De Castro offered her hand, which Goethe kissed. “Yeats and I were just discussing his latest plan to seed the world with English missionaries.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Surely you see that a common world language would serve the organization’s interests.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I suppose,” said Goethe. “But I weep at the prospect that this language would be <em class="calibre1">English</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It won’t be,” said de Castro. “It will be Spanish. English plateaued some time ago. It will take more than Yeats’s missionaries to reverse that.” She looked down her nose at Goethe, who stood a foot shorter. “I suppose these things are more alarming to delegates whose languages are in decline.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ah, it begins,” said Goethe. “The traditional German pile-on.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Honestly, I admire your spirit. It cannot be easy to watch your language slip into the footnotes of history.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It is doing no such thing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Although I suppose you must be used to humiliation,” said de Castro. “German being the second most popular Germanic language.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Children, please,” said Yeats.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">De Castro turned to him. “Did I hear correctly? Pushkin will be joining us via speakerphone?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Apparently.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I do hope we don’t need another Russian delegate. They’ve been dropping like flies. Alexander was doing so well.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s the language,” said Goethe. “Too many morphemes. Inherently vulnerable.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He can’t expect to save himself with a <em class="calibre1">speakerphone</em>. The idea is preposterous.” She used a German word for “preposterous,” <em class="calibre1">lächerlich</em>, slightly mangling the first syllable, watching Goethe as she did. So Yeats presumed that de Castro had dropped a little linguistic depth charge there. The entire meeting would be like this: delegates continually probing each other, seeking weakness. It was an inevitable by-product of the fact that the organization was a loose coalition of independent entities; no delegate outranked any other. Technically, Yeats was no more important than al-Zahawi of Arabic or Bharatendu Harishchandra of Hindi-Urdu. This was something he planned to change.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Let us assume Pushkin has other motives,” said Yeats, “and not waste our time together on speculation.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Agreed,” said de Castro. “Speaking of which, William, I was hoping you might be able to end some speculation of my own. Have you recovered your bareword?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His phone buzzed against his thigh, which was surprising, since everyone who knew that number should have known not to call it. “Sadly, no.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How disappointing,” said de Castro, “and, simultaneously, bullshit. William, none of us believe you would allow a bareword to lie in Broken Hill unmolested for almost a year.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The concept is extraordinary,” said Goethe.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We can discuss what you are willing to believe in the meeting,” Yeats said. “Which has not yet begun.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">De Castro glanced around the room. “There is a reason the other delegates have not approached you yet. I imagine it is the same reason Pushkin is not here at all.” Her eyes settled on him. “Do you plan to compromise us?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How ridiculous,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">De Castro watched him. Goethe said, “There is no denying you have been making efforts to retrieve it. However, the more time that passes, the more one wonders whether one is witnessing not <em class="calibre1">efforts</em> so much as <em class="calibre1">charades</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I do not have the bareword,” Yeats said. “For proof, please note the obvious fact that if I did, I would be using it to spare myself this conversation.” His phone buzzed again. “Excuse me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He turned away, plucked the phone from his pants, glanced at the screen, and repocketed it. He gazed into the distance, digesting the words: SIGHTING 3+1@95.65 IN 24 POI 665006.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The message was automated, sent by a computer whenever a person of interest—a PoI—was sniffed out by one of the vast number of surveillance systems to which he had access. Because those systems were less than perfectly reliable, possible sightings became messages only when the computer had accumulated sufficiently many of sufficient quality to pass a particular confidence level. In this case, they were informing him of three sightings in the past twenty-four hours, plus one from earlier, which were ninety-five percent likely to be Person of Interest number 665006, which, he knew from memory, was Virginia Woolf.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He returned to Goethe and de Castro. “Frankly,” said de Castro, as if no time had passed at all, “I see little point sitting down to discuss digital interconnectedness and social media when such an overwhelming issue remains unresolved.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It is resolved,” he said. “I honestly don’t know what else I can tell you.” It struck him as remarkably suspicious that there would be a Woolf sighting at this moment, in this meeting. He wondered which delegate was responsible.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can tell me the current location of Virginia Woolf,” said de Castro. “That troubles me, also.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We looked. We didn’t find her. It seems likely she is dead.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Goethe looked at de Castro. “He claims not to know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“William, I hear things,” said de Castro, “from people in your organization, as you no doubt hear things from people in mine. And the most disturbing tale has reached me. In it, Virginia Woolf steals the bareword and brings it to Broken Hill not out of some adolescent fit of pique, as you described, but rather at your command, as part of a test of the word’s effectiveness. Clearly, given the current population of Broken Hill is now zero, this test was a resounding success. Which is alarming in itself, William, for as much as we hold you in the highest regard, we are all undermined by your possession of a kind of persuasion against which there is no defense. But the part of this tale that troubles me most is the idea that Virginia Woolf, as your agent, is out there somewhere, engaged in some activity that serves your purpose. I cannot imagine what that might be. And that makes me most uncomfortable.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Throughout this, Yeats’s phone had continued to vibrate. He had developed the uncomfortable suspicion that the coincidence of Woolf’s sighting during this meeting might not be due to a delegate. It might be due to Woolf.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Confide in us,” said Goethe. “We are your allies, William.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I do not have the word,” he said. “And Virginia Woolf is dead. Now, I am terribly sorry, but I will not be able to attend our meeting after all. Something unavoidable has come up.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He took a chopper cross-town and set down on the DC office helipad. This occupied thirteen minutes. In the meantime, he attempted to coordinate people via his phone. This proved difficult because every few seconds it wanted to tell him about an incoming message, which required a tap to dismiss, and by the time the building was in sight this was what Yeats was spending the majority of his time doing, tapping to return his phone to a useful state. When a computer server became so busy acknowledging incoming requests that it had no time to respond to them, it was called a Denial of Service attack, a DoS. Yeats was being DoSed. He surrendered and put his phone away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Freed from the helicopter, he considered the elevator but opted for the flexibility of stairs. One flight later, he emerged into tastefully muted lighting. His assistant rose from her desk, mouth opening, full of messages. “Not now, thank you, Frances,” he said, and closed the double doors behind him. The lights brightened in response to his presence. This month, his office was a paean to eighteenth-century feudal Japan: paper dividers, low, simple furniture. On the wall behind his desk a samurai sword hung under lights. Yeats had chosen none of this; it was periodically redecorated in a random style, to avoid betraying personal aesthetics. He planted himself behind his desk and tapped the keyboard to wake his screens.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His predecessor hadn’t used a computer. They had been considered secretarial tools. Hard to imagine now. His displays filled with red boxes. Now that the computer’s thresholds had triggered, it was vomiting up sightings from days ago, even weeks, made newly plausible by more recent data. A voiceprint from a hotel in Istanbul. A woman with matching facial characteristics in Vancouver. He inspected the picture: sunglasses, hat, nothing he would bet on, but the computer liked the cheekbones. A taxicab security photo, grainy and desaturated, from a route that corresponded with what the computer was figuring out about Woolf’s movements. That was Seattle, yesterday. The notification boxes were a moving stream but Yeats managed to snag one with a recent time stamp. It was from the building’s security system. Its confidence level was ninety-nine percent. Woolf was outside, right now.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His office had a balcony. He was mildly tempted to go out and peer over the railing, see if he could pick her out. But that would be risky. That was, possibly, what Woolf wanted him to do. There could be a sniping issue. The fact was, as much as he believed he understood Woolf, she had been missing for a year and he had no idea how she had changed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His phone chimed. He felt rising excitement and waited until it was gone. “Yes?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m so terribly sorry. But there are so many people who wish to speak to you, and they’re saying quite alarming things.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is one of those people Frost?” The poet responsible for building security. Yeats had spoken to him from the chopper, in between phone notifications, and asked him to execute certain important, long-planned orders. Specifically, Frost was to fill the lobby with Environmentally Isolated Personnel, men and women with black suits and guns who saw the world through a computer-filtered display and heard nothing but white-listed words. These had proved insufficient to retrieve the word from Broken Hill—the teams sent in had rather spectacularly killed each other—but that meant nothing, because he had deliberately engineered it. He was fairly confident that they could stop Woolf.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, I haven’t heard from Frost.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll speak to Frost,” Yeats said. “No one else.” He closed the speaker. Red boxes continued to slide down his monitors. He saw the word LOBBY. He leaned back in his chair.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">So she’d entered the building. If all was proceeding as he’d instructed, Woolf would currently be on the floor, her hands bound in plastic, electrical tape being spread across her mouth. She would be lifted up and borne to a windowless cell. Then Frost would call.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He folded his hands and waited. A new red box slid up his screen. POI POSSIBLE SIGHTING: WOOLF, VIRGINIA. SECOND FLOOR. He looked at this awhile, trying to imagine circumstances in which Security might have decided to take Woolf up rather than down. He reached for the speaker. By the time he got the handset to his ear, a new notification had arrived. THIRD FLOOR. Was there a delay on these? A few seconds? It had never mattered before.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Frances, would you mind putting the floor into lockdown?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes, sir.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And please attempt to reach Frost.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right away.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His screen blanked. The lights went out. Part of the lockdown. Nothing to be concerned about. He waited. His breathing was steady. He felt no emotion. Minutes passed. The lights came on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He pressed for the speaker. “Frances, why has the lockdown lifted?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know. I’m finding out.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Noise in the background. Quite loud; he could almost feel its low echoes through the door. “Who else is there?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s . . . how can I help you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A female voice spoke. Indistinct; he couldn’t identify it. The phone clicked off. He slowly put it down.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He had recognized Woolf’s natural aptitude for attack very early on. It would have been disappointing if she’d fallen to Frost and the soldiers. He would have missed his chance to test himself. Of course, there was the real possibility that she was about to walk in here and destroy him. That was a concern.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These were feelings. He didn’t need them. He would prevail or he would not.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He steadied his breathing and began to pray. <em class="calibre1">O God, be with me and guide my hand. Let me transcend this petty flesh and become Your holy force.</em> Warmth spread through his body. His relationship with God was his greatest resource. It had allowed him to become who he was. So many promising colleagues had fallen to temptation. They managed their physiological needs, eating and breathing and fucking deliberately and on schedule, taking care to remain in control at all times, but their social needs—their basic human desire to love, to belong, and be loved—these were simply suppressed, because there was no safe way to indulge them. And yet they were named <em class="calibre1">needs</em> for a reason. The human animal craved intimacy at a biological level, relentlessly, insistent. Yeats had seen many promising careers derailed by surrenders to intimacy: men who whispered confessions to whores, women whose eyes lingered on children. On such small betrayals were psyches unraveled. He had unraveled several himself.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He had struggled in his early years. It seemed vaguely amusing now. Infantile. But he remembered the loneliness. The way his body reacted when a woman smiled at him, the surge of desire it evoked to join with her, not merely in a physical sense but beyond that, to confide and be understood. It had been almost overwhelming. Then he discovered God.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It had been terribly alarming. The very idea, a poet succumbing to religion! He was shocked at himself. But the feeling was undeniable and grew week by week. He could no longer believe he was alone. He began to see the divine in everything, from the circumvoluted fall of a leaf to the fortuitous arrival of an elevator. Occasionally, when the sterility of his job pressed close, he felt the presence of God like a figure in the room. God was with him. God loved him. It was ridiculous, but there it was.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was a tumor, of course. Oligodendroglioma, a cancerous growth in an area associated with feelings of enlightenment<em class="calibre1">.</em> The feelings it aroused could be reproduced through electrical stimulation. It wasn’t fatal, but it would need to be removed, his surgeon told him, as Yeats looked over the black-and-white scans, because it would continue to grow. Over time, there would be less and less of him and more of the tumor. His brain was being eaten by God.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He left the clinic in fine spirits. He had no intention of removing the tumor. It was the perfect solution to his dilemma: how to feed his body’s desire for intimacy. He was delusional, of course. There was no higher presence filling him with love, connecting him to all things. It only felt that way. But that was fine. That was ideal. He would not have trusted a God outside his head.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The door opened and a woman stepped through. She was wearing a long white coat that reached the floor. The hem was spattered black with liquid that might have been mud or dirt or might have been Frost. She had white gloves. A necklace, something on it that twisted and hurt to look at. He closed his eyes. He reached into his diaphragm for his strongest voice. “<em class="calibre1">Vartix velkor mannik wissick! Do not move!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was silence. “Ow,” said Woolf. “That kind of hurt.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He groped for his desk drawer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Credit to you, Yeats. I spent a long time preparing for you to say those words. And I still felt them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He got the drawer open. His fingers closed on a gun. He raised it and squeezed the trigger. He kept firing until the clip was empty. Then he dropped it to the carpet and listened.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Still here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was a sword on the wall behind him. Three hundred years old, but it could cut. He had no training. But that might not matter, if she came close enough. She might think it was decorative, until too late.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So I’m here to kill you,” she said, “just in case there was any doubt.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He breathed. He required a few moments to calm himself. “Emily.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Woolf,” she said. “Woolf, now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Interesting. Had she changed segments? It was possible. She might not have merely improved her defense but managed to alter her base personality in certain important ways. It could be done, with practice. In which case, she would be vulnerable to a different set of words. Yes. She would have rejected her previous self in order to distance herself from what she had done in Broken Hill. He needed to figure out what she had become. “How did you get here?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Walked, mostly.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The lobby was supposed to contain a fairly overwhelming number of security personnel.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The goggle guys? Yeah. They’re screened somehow, right? Filtered against compromise.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re supposed to be.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They are. But Frost isn’t.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ah,” he said. “So there were no goggle guys.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Nope.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Difficult to read a person you couldn’t see. The visual cues were so important. But it could be done. He could do it. The important thing was that she was still talking. “I gather you feel wronged by me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You could say that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” he said. “I won’t demean us both by pretending to apologize. But may I point out that killing me won’t serve your interests?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Actually, I disagree with you there. I mean, I thought about it. Come here with the word, make you run the organization for me; that would be interesting. And I can’t deny there is a real appeal in turning you into my slave for life. But that’s not an option. I have a little problem, you see. I picked it up in Broken Hill, when you sent me to deploy that kill order. I kind of looked at it. I caught a reflection. It wasn’t enough to compromise me. Not completely. It was backward, you know. And not very clear. But I think a piece of it got in there. I call it my star. That’s what it feels like. A star in my eye. It’s not very nice, Yeats. It wants me to do bad things. But I figured out a way to control it. I just need to concentrate on killing you. When I do that, the star isn’t so bad. I don’t feel like I need to hurt anyone else. So you see, you dying is kind of a nonnegotiable at this point.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He was fascinated. This part he had not known. “Then what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Excuse me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“After you murder me. What then?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s not really any of your concern.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I suppose not,” he said. “Very well. We will save that for later.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But there’s not going to be a later, Yeats. Not for you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Mmm,” he said. He had narrowed her down to a dozen or so segments. He was mildly tempted to run through words for them all, which he could do in about fifteen seconds. That was a last-resort kind of move, though. It would spark an immediate response from her, of whatever kind. He would keep that in his back pocket while he attempted to learn more. “Before we proceed, I feel I must confess something.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh?” He heard her coat scuff the carpet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You are here because of me. There is no part of these events I have not engineered. The most difficult part of the exercise, in fact, was finding excuses as to why I left the bareword in Broken Hill for so long. To be honest, I expected you to move faster. It was becoming untenable. But here you are. Bringing the word back to me, filled with vengeance, according to plan.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Really?” she said. “I have to tell you, from where I’m standing, that looks like a really shitty plan.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When I came to Broken Hill in the midst of its immolation, I found myself moved. I felt desire. I realized then the danger of the bareword. It would have corrupted me. It would have been my undoing, as unearned power always is, sooner or later. And I have no intention of wasting this life on temporary greatness. What I will do with the word once I’ve taken it from you is leave a mark on this world that will never be erased.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re not making a hell of a lot of sense, Yeats.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He shrugged slightly. “Perhaps my motives are beyond your comprehension. But I wish you to know that I don’t require words to make you perform my will. You are my puppet regardless. You stand here not because you willed it but because I did. Because defeating the bareword in your hands is the challenge I set myself to prove that I am ready to wield it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Dude, I’m going to kill you,” she said. “I’ve walked through every defense you have. There’s no doubt about that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He rose from his chair and spread his arms. He began to increase his breathing, although she shouldn’t notice that. Segment seventy-seven. He was sure of it. It was 220 with more fear and self-doubt. Often paired in families, interestingly: a 220 elder child and a seventy-seven younger sibling. It was plausible that Woolf might slide from one to the other. “Here I am,” he said. “Kill me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He heard her approach. There were two wide chairs opposite his desk, reducing the possible space she was occupying to a relatively small cuboid. Close enough to slice a sword through, if he was quick.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have no idea how much I want this, Yeats. I know it’s bad form to say that. That I <em class="calibre1">want</em>. But I do. I want it so much.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He could hear her breathing. Very close now. He could probably reach across the desk and touch her. He pulled air into lungs, preparing to speak the words that would make her his.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hey,” she said. “What’s that word? When the Japanese guys did something bad they’d atone by gutting themselves? You know? Disembowel themselves? What’s that called?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He didn’t answer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Seppuku,” she said. “I think that’s it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Doubt entered his mind. She was a seventy-seven, yes?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ve been planning this awhile, Yeats. Consider that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He considered. “<em class="calibre1">Kinnal forset hallassin aidel!</em>” He turned. His hands closed on wood. He drew the blade from the scabbard. “<em class="calibre1">Scream!</em>” This was to locate her. To provide a signal that he had analyzed her correctly. He lunged across the desk and swept the blade horizontally. It cut nothing but air, and he overbalanced.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not even close,” she said, from somewhere near the doorway.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He steadied himself, bringing up the blade. How foolish. He was disappointed in himself. It was that garbage about her name: <em class="calibre1">Woolf, now.</em> The purest bullshit, and he’d bought it. She was Emily, of course. She always would be.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He moved around the desk toward the sound of her voice, holding the blade flat, prepared for a stroke. He thought he heard something and jabbed speculatively. He turned in a slow half circle.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This way,” she said from the corridor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He felt his way to the doorway. In the corridor were strange whisperings. The vents? He felt surrounded. She had plans for him, apparently.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There are people here.” Her voice floated ahead of him. “Just so you know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He took two steps and stumbled over a chair. He felt the toe of his right shoe bend in a way that suggested a permanent crease and felt grief.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So I have a proposition for you, Yeats. You can open your eyes, look at this thing I’ve got around my neck, and follow my instructions to disembowel yourself. This way, nobody gets killed but you. Or you can stand there swinging that oversized butter knife while I send your own people against you. What do you say?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He ran at her. Someone grabbed his arms. He slashed the blade at his aggressor and there was a gasp and the hands fell back. He thrust the sword out again and felt it puncture something. Weight pulled at the blade and he retreated before he could lose it. Something thumped against the carpet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Congratulations,” Woolf said. “You killed your secretary.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He swiveled toward her voice, panting. The corridor was full of people. He could sense them. They were standing silently, waiting for his approach. To reach her he would need to kill them all.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So, no surprise,” she said. “I don’t know what I was expecting.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She was still a 220. She had practiced her defense. But he could find a way in. There was always something. A hidden desire or secret shame. With that, he could unravel her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He explored air with the sword tip. “You were never going to be one of us. Eliot thought you could learn to discipline yourself. But the idea was laughable. You could never learn to discipline your excesses.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know, Yeats. You may not be giving me enough credit there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He swiveled toward her voice. “Do you really think you can hide your mind from me?” He swung the blade. The tip glanced against something and he scrambled forward, slipping and sliding, got the blade into something, and pushed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yecck,” said Emily. “That was Frost.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Perhaps she was unsettled by violence. “<em class="calibre1">Vartix velkor mannik wissick! Scream!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">There was a pause. No screaming. “So you figured out I haven’t really changed. Congratulations. Not going to help you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can practically feel your emotions,” he said. “You radiate them. Tell me something, Emily. Why do you want me dead so much?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Isn’t it obvious?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think it’s because you need to blame me. You need to believe that what you did in Broken Hill was my fault.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It was.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But a part of you knows the truth. That if you had tried harder, you could have stopped it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Goddamn it, Yeats. You’re persistent. I’ll give you that. But I didn’t come here to listen to this. I was going to make you apologize of your own free will, but you know what, screw it. Open your fucking eyes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You tell yourself you had no choice but you don’t believe it. That is why you desire me dead. You hope to kill a part of yourself.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Grab him,” she said, to whom, he didn’t know. “Hold him down. Force open his eyes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He raised the sword. “Who killed that boy at the Academy? Was that me? He was the first to pay for the mistake of loving you with his life. But not the last.” Hands plucked at him. He flailed with the sword. “Did I make you a killer, or were you already?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shut up!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Vartix velkor mannik wissick! </em>You killed your lover! Scream!” Hands gripped him. “<em class="calibre1">Vartix velkor mannik wissick, you deserve to be punished, you deserve to die for what you did! Vartix velkor mannik wissick, scream, you evil bitch!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A weight of bodies bore him to the ground. Fingers groped at his face. Above this, a thin sound: a keening wail, like escaping steam.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Vartix velkor mannik wissick</em>,” he said. “<em class="calibre1">Emily, lie down and sleep!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyelids were dragged up. He saw faces he recognized, their expressions intent and focused. He knew their segments but nothing he could say would dissuade them from holding him down. He could work around that. He could convince them to release him once their duty was done. Because between the seething bodies, he saw a prone figure, sprawled on the carpet, her white coat gently rising and falling. His heart sang, because it was over, and he had won.</p>
