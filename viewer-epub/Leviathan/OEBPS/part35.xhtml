      <h2>Miller knew him. A year and a half ago, heâ€™d arrested him...</h2>
      <p>Whatever this was, it had been going on a long time before the Canterbury had picked up a distress call from the Scopuli. A long time before Julie had vanished. And putting a bunch of Ceres Station thugs in charge of Eros crowd control using stolen Ceres Station equipment had been part of the plan. The third phase.</p>
      <p>Ah, he thought. Well. That canâ€™t be good.</p>
      <p>Miller slid to the side, letting as many bodies as he plausibly could fill the space between him and the gunmen dressed as police.</p>
      <p>â€œGet down to the casino level,â€� one of the gunmen shouted over the crowd. â€œWeâ€™ll get you into the radiation shelters from there, but youâ€™ve got to get to the casino level!â€�</p>
      <p>Holden and his crew hadnâ€™t noticed anything odd. They were talking among themselves, strategizing about how to get to their ship and what to do once they got there, speculating about who might have attacked the station and where Julie Maoâ€™s twisted, infected corpse might be headed. Miller fought the impulse to interrupt them. He needed to stay calm, to think things through. They couldnâ€™t attract attention. He needed the right moment.</p>
      <p>The corridor turned and widened. The press of bodies lightened a little bit. Miller waited for a dead zone in the crowd control, a space where none of the fake security men could see them. He took Holden by the elbow.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t go,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>n width=“0pt” align=“right”>Chapter Twenty-Seven: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>What do you mean, donâ€™t go?â€� Holden asked, yanking his elbow out of Millerâ€™s grasp. â€œSomebody just nuked the station. This has escalated beyond our capacity to respond. If we canâ€™t get to the Roci, weâ€™re doing whatever they tell us to until we can.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller took a step back and put up his hands; he was clearly doing his best to look nonthreatening, which just pissed Holden off even more. Behind him, the riot cops were motioning the people milling in the corridors toward the casinos. The air echoed with the electronically amplified voices of the police directing the crowds and the buzz of anxious citizens. Over it all, the public-address system told everyone to remain calm and cooperate with emergency personnel.</p>
      <p>â€œSee that bruiser over there in the police riot gear?â€� Miller said. â€œHis name is Gabby Smalls. He supervises a chunk of the Golden Bough protection racket on Ceres. He also runs a little dust on the side, and I suspect heâ€™s tossed more than a few people out airlocks.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden looked at the guy. Wide shoulders, thick gut. Now that Miller pointed him out, there was something about him that didnâ€™t seem right for a cop.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t get it,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œA couple months ago, when you started a bunch of riots by saying Mars blew up your water hauler, we found outâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI never saidâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œâ€”found out that most of the police riot gear on Ceres was missing. A few months before that, a bunch of our underworld muscle went missing. I just found out where both of them are.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller pointed at the riot-gear-equipped Gabby Smalls.</p>
      <p>â€œI wouldnâ€™t go wherever heâ€™s sending people,â€� he said. â€œI really wouldnâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>A thin stream of people bumped past.</p>
      <p>â€œThen where?â€� Naomi asked.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, I mean, if the choice is radiation or mobsters, I gotta go with the mobsters,â€� Alex said, nodding emphatically at Naomi.</p>
      <p>Miller pulled out his hand terminal and held it up so everyone could see the screen.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve got no radiation warnings,â€� he said. â€œWhatever happened outside isnâ€™t a danger on this level. Not right now. So letâ€™s just calm down and make the smart move.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden turned his back on Miller and motioned to Naomi. He pulled her aside and said in a quiet voice, â€œI still think we go back to the ship and get out of here. Take our chances getting past these mobsters.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf thereâ€™s no radiation danger, then I agree,â€� she said with a nod.</p>
      <p>â€œI disagree,â€� Miller said, not even pretending he hadnâ€™t been eavesdropping. â€œTo do that we have to walk through three levels of casino filled with riot gear and thugs. Theyâ€™re going to tell us to get in one of those casinos for our own protection. When we donâ€™t, theyâ€™ll beat us unconscious and throw us in anyway. For our own protection.â€�</p>
      <p>Another crowd of people poured out of a branch corridor, heading for the reassuring presence of the police and the bright casino lights. Holden found it difficult not to be swept along with the crowd. A man with two enormous suitcases bn wi sitcumped into Naomi, almost knocking her down. Holden grabbed her hand.</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™s the alternative?â€� he asked Miller.</p>
      <p>Miller glanced up and down the corridor, seeming to measure the flow of people. He nodded at a yellow-and-black-striped hatch down a small maintenance corridor.</p>
      <p>â€œThat one,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s marked HIGH VOLTAGE, so the guys sweeping for stragglers wonâ€™t bother with it. Itâ€™s not the kind of place citizens hide.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCan you get that door open quickly?â€� Holden said, looking at Amos.</p>
      <p>â€œCan I break it?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf you need to.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThen sure,â€� Amos said, and began pushing his way through the crowd toward the maintenance hatch. At the door, he pulled out his multi-tool and popped off the cheap plastic housing for the card reader. After he twisted a couple of wires together, the hatch slid open with a hydraulic hiss.</p>
      <p>â€œTa-da,â€� Amos said. â€œThe reader wonâ€™t work anymore, so anyone who wants in comes in.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLetâ€™s worry about that if it happens,â€� Miller replied, then led them into the dimly lit passageway beyond.</p>
      <p>The service corridor was filled with electrical cable held together with plastic ties. It stretched through the dim red light for thirty or forty feet before falling into gloom. The light came from LEDs mounted on the metal bracing that sprouted from the wall every five feet or so to hold the cable up. Naomi had to duck to enter, her frame about four centimeters too tall for the ceiling. She put her back to the wall and slid down onto her haunches.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™d think theyâ€™d make the maintenance corridors tall enough for Belters to work in,â€� she said irritably.</p>
      <p>Holden touched the wall almost reverently, tracing a corridor identification number carved right into the stone.</p>
      <p>â€œThe Belters who built this place werenâ€™t tall,â€� he said. â€œThese are some of the main power lines. This tunnel goes back to the first Belt colony. The people who carved it grew up in gravity.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller, who also had to duck his head, sat on the floor with a grunt and popping knees.</p>
      <p>â€œHistory lesson later,â€� he said. â€œLetâ€™s figure a way off this rock.â€�</p>
      <p>Amos, studying the bundles of cable intently, said over his shoulder, â€œIf you see a frayed spot, donâ€™t touch it. This thick fucker right here is a couple million volts. Thatâ€™d melt your shit down real good.â€�</p>
      <p>Alex sat down next to Naomi, grimacing when his butt hit the cold stone floor.</p>
      <p>â€œYou know,â€� he said, â€œif they decide to seal up the station, they might pump all the air outta these maintenance corridors.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI get it,â€� Holden said loudly. â€œItâ€™s a shitty and uncomfortable hiding spot. You have my permission to now shut up about that.â€�</p>
      <p>He squatted down across the corridor from Miller and said, â€œOkay, Detective. Now what?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNow,â€� Miller said, â€œwe wait for the sweep to pass us by, and get behind it, try to get to the docks. The folks in the shelters are easy to avoid. Shelters are up deep. Trickâ€™s going to be getting through the casino levels.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCanâ€™t we just use these mai€œCa sthentenance passages to move around?â€� Alex asked.</p>
      <p>Amos shook his head. â€œNot without a map, we wonâ€™t. You get lost in here, youâ€™re in trouble,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Ignoring them, Holden said, â€œOkay, so we wait for everyone to move to the radiation shelters and then we leave.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded at him, and then the two men sat staring at each other for a moment. The air between them seemed to thicken, the silence taking on a meaning of its own. Miller shrugged like his jacket itched.</p>
      <p>â€œWhy do you think a bunch of Ceres mobsters are moving everyone to radiation shelters when thereâ€™s no actual radiation danger?â€� Holden finally said. â€œAnd why are the Eros cops letting them?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood questions,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œIf they were using these yahoos, it helps explain why their attempted kidnapping at the hotel went so poorly. They donâ€™t seem like pros.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNope,â€� Miller said. â€œThatâ€™s not their usual area of expertise.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWould you two be quiet?â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>For almost a minute they were.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™d be really stupid,â€� Holden said, â€œto go take a look at whatâ€™s going on, wouldnâ€™t it?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes. Whateverâ€™s going on at those shelters, you know thatâ€™s where all the guards and patrols will be,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œCaptain,â€� Naomi said, a warning in her voice.</p>
      <p>â€œStill,â€� Holden said, talking to Miller, â€œyou hate a mystery.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI do at that,â€� Miller replied with a nod and a faint smile. â€œAnd you, my friend, are a damn busybody.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s been said.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGoddamn it,â€� Naomi said quietly.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat is it, Boss?â€� Amos asked.</p>
      <p>â€œThese two just broke our getaway plan,â€� Naomi replied. Then she said to Holden, â€œYou guys are going to be very bad for each other and, by extension, us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Holden replied. â€œYou arenâ€™t coming along. You stay here with Amos and Alex. Give usâ€�â€”he looked at his terminalâ€”â€œthree hours to go look and come back. If we arenâ€™t hereâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe leave you to the gangsters and the three of us get jobs on Tycho and live happily ever after,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Holden said with a grin. â€œDonâ€™t be a hero.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWouldnâ€™t even consider it, sir.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Holden crouched in the shadows outside the maintenance hatch and watched as Ceres mobsters dressed in police riot gear led the citizens of Eros away in small groups. The PA system continued to declare the possibility of radiological danger and exhorted the citizens and guests of Eros to cooperate fully with emergency personnel. Holden had selected a group to follow and was getting ready to move when Miller placed a hand on his shoulder.</p>
      <p>â€œWait,â€� Miller said. â€œI want to make a call.â€�</p>
      <p>He quickly dialed up a number on hiuick sbers hand terminal, and after a few moments, a flat gray Network Not Available message appeared.</p>
      <p>â€œPhone is down?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s the first thing Iâ€™d do, too,â€� Miller replied.</p>
      <p>â€œI see,â€� Holden said even though he really didnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, I guess itâ€™s just you and me,â€� Miller said, then took the magazine out of his gun and began reloading it with cartridges he pulled out of his coat pocket.</p>
      <p>Even though heâ€™d had enough of gunfights to last him the rest of his life, Holden took out his gun and checked the magazine as well. Heâ€™d replaced it after the shoot-out in the hotel, and it was full. He racked it and put it back in the waistband of his pants. Miller, he noticed, kept his out, holding it close to his thigh, where his coat mostly covered it.</p>
      <p>It wasnâ€™t difficult following the groups up through the station toward the inner sections where the radiation shelters were. As long as they kept moving in the same direction as the crowds, no one gave them a second look. Holden made a mental note of the many corridor intersections where men in riot gear stood guard. It would be much tougher coming back down.</p>
      <p>When the group they were following eventually stopped outside a large metal door marked with the ancient radiation symbol, Holden and Miller slipped off to the side and hid behind a large planter filled with ferns and a couple of stunted trees. Holden watched the fake riot cops order everyone into the shelter and then seal the door behind them with the swipe of a card. All but one of them left, the remaining one standing guard outside the door.</p>
      <p>Miller whispered, â€œLetâ€™s ask him to let us in.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFollow my lead,â€� Holden replied, then stood up and began walking toward the guard.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, shithead, you supposed to be in a shelter or in the casino, so get the fuck back to your group,â€� the guard said, his hand on the butt of his gun.</p>
      <p>Holden held up his hands placatingly, smiled, and kept walking. â€œHey, I lost my group. Got mixed up somehow. Iâ€™m not from here, you know,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>The guard pointed down the corridor with the stun baton in his left hand.</p>
      <p>â€œGo that way till you hit the ramps down,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Miller seemed to appear out of nowhere in the dimly lit corridor, his gun already out and pointed at the guardâ€™s head. He thumbed off the safety with an audible click.</p>
      <p>â€œHow about we just join the group already inside?â€� he said. â€œOpen it up.â€�</p>
      <p>The guard looked at Miller out of the corners of his eyes, not turning his head at all. His hands went up, and he dropped the baton.</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t want to do that, man,â€� the fake cop said.</p>
      <p>â€œI kind of think he does,â€� Holden said. â€œYou should do what he says. Heâ€™s not a very nice person.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller pushed the barrel of his gun against the guardâ€™s head and said, â€œYou know what we used to call a â€˜no-brainerâ€™ back at the station house? Itâ€™s when a shot to the head actually blows the entire brain out of someoneâ€™s skull. It usually happens when a gun is pressed to the victimâ€™s head right about here. The gasâ€™s got nowhere to go. Pops the brain right out through the exit wound.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey said noalig sy st to open these up once theyâ€™d been sealed, man,â€� the guard said, speaking so fast he ran all the words together. â€œThey were pretty serious about that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThis is the last time I ask,â€� Miller said. â€œNext time I just use the card I took off your body.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden turned the guard around to face the door and pulled the handgun out of the manâ€™s belt holster. He hoped all Millerâ€™s threats were just threats. He suspected they werenâ€™t.</p>
      <p>â€œJust open the door, and weâ€™ll let you go, I promise,â€� Holden said to the guard.</p>
      <p>The guard nodded and moved up to the door, then slid his card through it and punched in a number on the keypad. The heavy blast door slid open. Beyond it, the room was even darker than the corridor outside. A few emergency LEDs glowed a sullen red. In the faint illumination, Holden could see dozensâ€¦ hundreds of bodies scattered across the floor, unmoving.</p>
      <p>â€œAre they dead?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know nothing aboutâ€”â€� the guard said, but Miller cut him off.</p>
      <p>â€œYou go in first,â€� Miller said, and pushed the guard forward.</p>
      <p>â€œHold on,â€� Holden said. â€œI donâ€™t think itâ€™s a good idea to just charge in here.â€�</p>
      <p>Three things happened at once. The guard took four steps forward and then collapsed on the floor. Miller sneezed once, loudly, and then started to sway drunkenly. And both Holdenâ€™s and Millerâ€™s hand terminals began an angry electric buzzing.</p>
      <p>Miller staggered back and said, â€œThe doorâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>Holden hit the button and the door slid shut again.</p>
      <p>â€œGas,â€� Miller said, then coughed. â€œThereâ€™s gas in there.â€�</p>
      <p>While the ex-cop leaned against the corridor wall and coughed, Holden took out his terminal to shut off the buzzing. But the alarm flashing on its screen wasnâ€™t an air-contamination alert. It was the venerable three wedge shapes pointing inward. Radiation. As he watched, the symbol, which should have been white, shifted through an angry orange color to dark red.</p>
      <p>Miller was looking at his too, his expression unreadable.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™ve been dosed,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve never actually seen the detector activate,â€� Miller said, his voice rough and faint after his coughing fit. â€œWhat does it mean when the thing is red?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt means weâ€™ll be bleeding from our rectums in about six hours,â€� Holden said. â€œWe have to get to the ship. Itâ€™ll have the meds we need.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat,â€� Miller said, â€œthe fuckâ€¦ is going on?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden grabbed Miller by the arm and led him back down the corridor toward the ramps. Holdenâ€™s skin felt warm and itchy. He didnâ€™t know if it was radiation burn or psychosomatic. With the amount of radiation heâ€™d just taken, it was a good thing he had sperm tucked away in Montana and on Europa.</p>
      <p>Thinking that made his balls itch.</p>
      <p>â€œThey nuke the station,â€� Holden said. â€œHell, maybe they just pretend to nuke it. Then they drag everyone down here and toss them into radiation shelters that are only radioactive on the inside. Gas them to keep them quiet.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThere are easier ways to kill people,â€� Miller wa sâ€�r said, his breathing coming in ragged gasps as they ran down the corridor.</p>
      <p>â€œSo it has to be more than that,â€� Holden said. â€œThe bug, right? The one that killed that girl. Itâ€¦ fed on radiation.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIncubators,â€� Miller said, nodding in agreement.</p>
      <p>They arrived at one of the ramps to the lower levels, but a group of citizens led by two fake riot cops were coming up. Holden grabbed Miller and pulled him to one side, where they could hide in the shadow of a closed noodle shop.</p>
      <p>â€œSo they infected them, right?â€� Holden said in a whisper, waiting for the group to pass. â€œMaybe fake radiation meds with the bug in it. Maybe that brown goo just spread around on the floor. Then whatever was in the girl, Julieâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>He stopped when Miller walked away from him straight at the group that had just come up the ramp.</p>
      <p>â€œOfficer,â€� said Miller to one of the fake cops.</p>
      <p>They both stopped, and one of them said, â€œYou supposed to beâ€”â€�</p>
