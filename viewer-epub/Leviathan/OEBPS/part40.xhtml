      <h2>Miller nodded. â€œGot shot. Armâ€™s broke. Keep moving,â€�...</h2>
      <p>Holden climbed to his feet, his left leg feeling like it was on fire as the muscle in his calf clenched around his gaping wound. He pulled Miller up and then leaned on him as they limped toward the elevator. Millerâ€™s left arm was dangling boneless at his side, and blood was pouring off his hand.</p>
      <p>Holden punched the button to call the lift, and he and Miller leaned on each other while they waited. He hummed the Misko and Marisko theme to himself, and after a few seconds, Miller started too.</p>
      <p>Holden punched the button for the Rocinanteâ€™s berth and waited for the elevator to stop at a blank gray airlock door with no ship beyond it. That would be when he finally had permission to lie down on the floor and die. He looked forward to that moment when his exertions could end with a relief that would have surprised him  thatpt"ed him if heâ€™d still been capable of surprise. Miller let go of him and slid down the lift wall, leaving a blood trail on the shiny metal and ending in a pile on the floor. The manâ€™s eyes were closed. He could almost have been sleeping. Holden watched the detectiveâ€™s chest rise and fall in ragged, painful breaths that grew smoother and more shallow.</p>
      <p>Holden envied him, but he had to see that closed airlock door before he could lie down. He began to feel faintly angry with the elevator for taking so long.</p>
      <p>It stopped, lift doors sliding open with a cheerful ding.</p>
      <p>Amos stood in the airlock on the other side, an assault rifle in each hand and two belts of magazines for the rifles slung on his shoulders. He looked Holden up and down once, then glanced over to Miller and back again.</p>
      <p>â€œJesus, Captain, you look like shit.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Thirty-Two: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Millerâ€™s mind reassembled slowly and with several false starts. In his dreams, he was fitting a puzzle together as the pieces kept changing shape, and each time, just as he was on the verge of slipping the whole mechanism together, the dream began again. The first thing he became aware of was the ache at the small of his back, then the heaviness of his arms and legs, then the nausea. The nearer he came to consciousness, the more he tried to postpone it. Imaginary fingers tried to complete the puzzle, and before he could make it all fit, his eyes opened.</p>
      <p>He couldnâ€™t move his head. Something was in his neck: a thick bundle of black tubes reaching out of him and up past the limits of his vision. He tried to lift his arms, to push the invading, vampiric thing away, but he couldnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>It got me, he thought with a thrill of fear. Iâ€™m infected.</p>
      <p>The woman appeared from his left. He was surprised she wasnâ€™t Julie. Deep brown skin, dark eyes with just a hint of an epicanthic fold. She smiled at him. Black hair draped down the side of her face.</p>
      <p>Down. There was a down. There was gravity. They were under thrust. That seemed very important, but he didnâ€™t know why.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, Detective,â€� Naomi said. â€œWelcome back.â€�</p>
      <p>Where am I? he tried to say. His throat felt solid. Crowded like too many people in a tube station.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t try to get up or talk or anything,â€� she said. â€œYouâ€™ve been under for about thirty-six hours. Good news is we have a sick bay with a military-grade expert system and supplies for fifteen Martian soldiers. I think we burned half of what weâ€™ve got on you and the captain.â€�</p>
      <p>The captain. Holden. That was right. Theyâ€™d been in a fight. There had been a corridor and people shooting. And someone had been sick. He remembered a woman, covered in brown vomit, with vacant eyes, but he didnâ€™t know whether it was part of a nightmare.</p>
      <p>Naomi was still talking. Something about full plasma flushes and cell damage. He tried to lift a hand, to reach out to her, but a strap restrained him. The ache in his back was his kidneys, and he wondered what exactly was getting filtered out of his blood. Miller closed his eyes, asleep before he could decide whether to rest.</p>
      <p>No dreams troubled him this time. He roused again when something deep in his throat shifted, pu deepThe…lled at his larynx, and retreated. Without opening his eyes, he rolled to his side, coughed, puked, and rolled back.</p>
      <p>When he woke, he was breathing on his own. His throat felt sore and abused, but his hands werenâ€™t tied down. Drainage tubes ran out of his belly and side, and there was a catheter the size of a pencil coming out his penis. Nothing particularly hurt, so he had to assume he was on pretty nearly all the narcotics there were. His clothes were gone, his modesty preserved only by a thin paper gown and a cast that held his left arm stony and immovable. Someone had put his hat on the next bed over.</p>
      <p>The sick bay, now that he could see it, looked like a ward on a high-production entertainment feed. It wasnâ€™t a hospital; it was the matte-black-and-silver idea of what a hospital was supposed to be. The monitors hung suspended in the air on complex armatures, reporting his blood pressure, nucleic acid concentrations, oxygenation, fluid balance. There were two separate countdowns running, one to the next round of autophagics, the other for pain medication. And across the aisle, at another station, Holdenâ€™s statistics looked more or less the same.</p>
      <p>Holden looked like a ghost. His skin was pale and his sclera were red with a hundred little hemorrhages. His face was puffy from steroids.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Holden lifted a hand, waving gently.</p>
      <p>â€œWe made it,â€� Miller said. His voice sounded like it had been dragged down an alley by its ankles.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œThat was ugly.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded. That had taken all the energy he had. He lay back down and fell, if not asleep, at least unconscious. Just before his mind flickered back into forgetfulness, he smiled. Heâ€™d made it. He was on Holdenâ€™s ship. And they were going to find whatever Julie had left behind for them.</p>
      <p>Voices woke him.</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe you shouldnâ€™t, then.â€�</p>
      <p>It was the woman. Naomi. Part of Miller cursed her for disturbing him, but there was a buzz in her voiceâ€”not fear or anger, but close enough to be interesting. He didnâ€™t move, didnâ€™t even swim all the way back to awareness. But he listened.</p>
      <p>â€œI need to,â€� Holden said. He sounded phlegmy, like someone who needed to cough. â€œWhat happened on Erosâ€¦ itâ€™s put a lot of things in perspective. Iâ€™ve been a holding something back.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCaptainâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, hear me out. When I was in there thinking that all I was going to have left was half an hour of rigged pachinko games and then deathâ€¦ when that happened, I knew what my regrets were. You know? I felt all the things that I wished Iâ€™d done and never had the courage for. Now that I know, I canâ€™t just ignore it. I canâ€™t pretend it isnâ€™t there.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCaptain,â€� Naomi said again, and the buzz in her voice was stronger.</p>
      <p>Donâ€™t say it, you poor bastard, Miller thought.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m in love with you, Naomi,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>The pause lasted no longer than a heartbeat.</p>
      <p>â€œNo, sir,â€� she said. â€œYou arenâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI am. I know what youâ€™re thinking. Iâ€™ve been through this big traumatic experienceh thitheerience and Iâ€™m doing the whole thing where I want to affirm life and make connections, and maybe some of thatâ€™s part of it. But you have to believe that I know what I feel. And when I was down there, I knew that the thing that I wanted the most was to get back to you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCaptain. How long have we served together?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat? I donâ€™t know exactlyâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBallpark estimate.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEight and a half runs makes it almost five years,â€� Holden said. Miller could hear the confusion in his voice.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right. And in that time, how many of the crew did you share bunks with?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDoes it matter?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOnly a little.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œA few.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMore than a dozen?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� he said, but he didnâ€™t sound sure.</p>
      <p>â€œLetâ€™s call it ten,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay. But this is different. Iâ€™m not talking about having a little shipboard romance to pass the time. Ever sinceâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>Miller imagined the woman holding up her hand or taking Holdenâ€™s or maybe just glaring at him. Something to stop the flow of words.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd do you know when I fell for you, sir?â€�</p>
      <p>Sorrow. That was what the strain in her voice was. Sorrow. Disappointment. Regret.</p>
      <p>â€œWhenâ€¦ when youâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI can tell you the day,â€� Naomi said. â€œYou were about seven weeks into that first run. I was still smarting that some Earther had come in from out of the ecliptic and taken my XO job. I didnâ€™t like you much right at the start. You were too charming, too pretty, and too damn comfortable in my chair. But there was a poker game in the engine room. You and me and those two Luna boys out of engineering and Kamala Trask. You remember Trask?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe was the comm tech. The one who wasâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBuilt like a refrigerator? Face like a bulldog puppy?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI remember her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe had the biggest crush on you. Used to cry herself to sleep at night all through that run. She wasnâ€™t in that game because she cared about poker. She just wanted to breathe some of your air, and everyone knew it. Even you. And all that night, I watched you and her, and you never once led her along. You never gave her any reason to think she had a chance with you. And you still treated her with respect. That was the first time I thought you might be a decent XO, and it was the first time I wished that I could be the girl in your bunk at shiftâ€™s end.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBecause of Trask?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat and youâ€™ve got a great ass, sir. My point is we flew together for four years and more. And I would have come along with you any day of that if youâ€™d asked me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI didnâ€™t know,â€� Holden said. He sounded a little strangled.</p>
      <p>â€œYou didnâ€™t ask. You always had your sights set someplace else. And, honestly, I think Belter women just put you off. Until the Cantâ€¦ Until it was just the five of us. Iâ€™ve seen you looking at me. I know exactly what those looks mean, because I spent four years on the other side of them. But I only got your attention when I waly goirsen I was the only female on board, and thatâ€™s not good enough for me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, sir, you donâ€™t. Thatâ€™s my point. Iâ€™ve watched you seduce a lot of women, and I know how you do it. You get fixed on her, you get excited by her. Then you convince yourself that the two of you have some kind of special connection, and by the time you believe it, she usually thinks itâ€™s true too. And then you sleep together for a while, and the connection gets a little faded. One or the other of you says something like professional or appropriate boundaries or starts worrying what the crew will think, and the whole thing slides away. Afterwards they still like you. All of them. You do it all so well they donâ€™t even feel like they get to hate you for it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s not true.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt is. And until you figure out that you donâ€™t have to love everyone you bed down with, Iâ€™m never going to know whether you love me or just want to bed down. And I wonâ€™t sleep with you until you know which it is. The smart money isnâ€™t on love.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI was justâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf you want to sleep with me,â€� Naomi said, â€œbe honest. Respect me enough for that. Okay?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller coughed. He hadnâ€™t meant to, hadnâ€™t even been aware he was going to. His belly went tight, his throat clamped down, and he coughed wet and deep. Once he started, it was hard to stop. He sat up, eyes watering from the effort. Holden was lying back on his bed. Naomi sat on the next bed over, smiling like there had been nothing to overhear. Holdenâ€™s monitors showed an elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Miller could only hope the poor bastard hadnâ€™t gotten an erection with the catheter still in.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, Detective,â€� Naomi said. â€œHowâ€™re you feeling?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve felt worse,â€� he said. Then, a moment later: â€œNo. I havenâ€™t. But Iâ€™m all right. How bad was it?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re both dead,â€� Naomi said. â€œSeriously, we had to override the triage filters on both of you more than once. The expert system kept clicking you over into hospice care and shooting you full of morphine.â€�</p>
      <p>She said it lightly, but he believed her. He tried to sit up. His body still felt terribly heavy, but he didnâ€™t know if it was from weakness or the ship thrust. Holden was quiet, jaw clamped tight. Miller pretended not to notice.</p>
      <p>â€œLong-term estimates?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re both going to need to be checked for new cancers every month for the rest of your lives. The captain has a new implant where his thyroid used to be, since his real one was pretty much cooked down. We had to take out about a foot and a half of your small bowel that wouldnâ€™t stop bleeding. Youâ€™re both going to bruise easy for a while, and if you wanted kids, I hope you have some sperm in a bank someplace, because all your little soldiers have two heads now.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller chuckled. His monitors blinked into alarm mode and then back out.</p>
      <p>â€œYou sound like you trained as a med tech,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œNope. Engineer. But Iâ€™ve been reading the printouts every day, so Iâ€™ve got the lingo down. I wish Shed was still here,â€� she said, and sounded sad for the first time.</p>
      <p>That was the second time someone had mentioned Shed. There was a story there, but MiTheres p but Miller let it drop.</p>
      <p>â€œHair going to fall out?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe,â€� Naomi said. â€œThe system shot you full of the drugs that are supposed to stop that, but if the follicles die, they die.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWell. Good thing Iâ€™ve still got my hat. What about Eros?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomiâ€™s false light tone failed her.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s dead,â€� Holden said from his bed, turning to look at Miller. â€œI think we were the last ship out. The station isnâ€™t answering calls, and all the automatic systems have it in a quarantine lockdown.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRescue ships?â€� Miller asked, and coughed again. His throat was still sore.</p>
      <p>â€œNot going to happen,â€� Naomi said. â€œThere were a million and a half people on station. No one has the resources to put into that kind of rescue op.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAfter all,â€� Holden said, â€œthereâ€™s a war on.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The ship system dimmed the lights for night. Miller lay on his bed. The expert system had shifted his treatment regimen into a new phase, and for the past three hours, heâ€™d alternated between spiking fevers and teeth-chattering chills. His teeth and the nail beds of his fingers and toes ached. Sleep wasnâ€™t an option, so he lay in the gloom and tried to pull himself together.</p>
      <p>He wondered what his old partners would have made of his behavior on Eros. Havelock. Muss. He tried to imagine them in his place. Heâ€™d killed people, and heâ€™d done it cold. Eros had been a kill box, and when the people in charge of the law wanted you dead, the law didnâ€™t apply anymore. And some of the dead assholes had been the ones whoâ€™d killed Julie.</p>
      <p>So. Revenge killing. Was he really down to revenge killing? That was a sad thought. He tried to imagine Julie sitting beside him the way Naomi had with Holden. It was like sheâ€™d been waiting for the invitation. Julie Mao, who heâ€™d never really known. She raised a hand in greeting.</p>
      <p>And what about us? he asked her as he looked into her dark, unreal eyes. Do I love you, or do I just want to love you so bad I canâ€™t tell the difference?</p>
      <p>â€œHey, Miller,â€� Holden said, and Julie vanished. â€œYou awake?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah. Canâ€™t sleep.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMe either.â€�</p>
      <p>They were silent for a moment. The expert system hummed. Millerâ€™s left arm itched under its cast as the tissue went through another round of forced regrowth.</p>
      <p>â€œYou doing okay?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œWhy wouldnâ€™t I be?â€� Holden said sharply.</p>
      <p>â€œYou killed that guy,â€� Miller said. â€œBack on the station. You shot him. I mean, I know you shot at guys before that. Back at the hotel. But right at the end there, you actually hit somebody in the face.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah. I did.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou good with that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure,â€� Holden said, too quickly.</p>
      <p>The air recyclers hummed, and the blood pressure cuff on Millerâ€™s good arm squeezed him like a hand. Holden didnâ€™t speak, but when Miller squinted, he could see the elevated blood pressld seh="d pressure and the uptick in brain activity.</p>
      <p>â€œThey always made us take time off,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhen we shot someone. Whether they died or not, they always made us take a leave of absence. Turn in our weapon. Go talk to the headshrinker.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBureaucrats,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œThey had a point,â€� Miller said. â€œShooting someone does something to you. Killing someoneâ€¦ thatâ€™s even worse. Doesnâ€™t matter that they had it coming or you didnâ€™t have a choice. Or maybe a little difference. But it doesnâ€™t take it away.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSeems like you got over it, though.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe,â€� Miller said. â€œLook. All that I said back there about how you kill someone? About how leaving them alive wasnâ€™t doing them any favors? Iâ€™m sorry that happened.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou think you were wrong?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI wasnâ€™t. But Iâ€™m still sorry it happened.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJesus. Look, Iâ€™m saying itâ€™s good that it bothers you. Itâ€™s good that you canâ€™t stop seeing it or hearing it. That part where it haunts you some? Thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s supposed to be.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden was quiet for a moment. When he spoke again, his voice was gray as stone.</p>
