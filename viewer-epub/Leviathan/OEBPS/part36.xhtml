      <h2>Miller shot him in the throat, right below his helmetâ€™s...</h2>
      <p>A couple of the citizens started screaming. Miller pointed his gun at them and they got quiet.</p>
      <p>â€œGo down a level or two and find someplace to hide,â€� he said. â€œDo not cooperate with these men, even though theyâ€™re dressed like police. They do not have your best interests at heart. Go.â€�</p>
      <p>The citizens hesitated, then ran. Miller took a few cartridges out of his pocket and began replacing the three heâ€™d fired. Holden started to speak, but Miller cut him off.</p>
      <p>â€œTake the throat shot if you can. Most people, the faceplate and chest armor donâ€™t quite cover that gap. If the neck is covered, then shoot the inside of the thigh. Very thin armor there. Mobility issue. Takes most people down in one shot.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden nodded, as though that all made sense.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden said. â€œSay, letâ€™s get back to the ship before we bleed to death, right? No more shooting people if we can help it.â€� His voice sounded calmer than he felt.</p>
      <p>Miller slapped the magazine back into his gun and chambered a round.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m guessing thereâ€™s a lot more people need to be shot before this is over,â€� he said. â€œBut sure. First things first.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Twenty-Eight: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The first time Miller killed anyone was in his third year working security. Heâ€™d been twenty-two, just married, talking about having kids. As the new guy on the contract, heâ€™d gotten the shit jobs: patrolling levels so high the Coriolis made him seasick, taking domestic disturbance calls in holes no wider than a storage bin, standing guard on the drunk tank to keep predators from raping the unconscious. The normal hazing. Heâ€™d known to expect it. Heâ€™d thought he could take it.</p>
      <p>The call had been from an illegal restaurant almost at the mass center. At less than a tenth of a g, gravity had been little more than a suggestion, and his inner ear hsugg vad been confused and angered by the change in spin. If he thought about it, he could still remember the sound of raised voices, too fast and slurred for words. The smell of bathtub cheese. The thin haze of smoke from the cheap electric griddle.</p>
      <p>It had happened fast. The perp had come out of the hole with a gun in one hand, dragging a woman by the hair with the other. Millerâ€™s partner, a ten-year veteran named Carson, had shouted out the warning. The perp had turned, swinging the gun out at armâ€™s length like a stuntman in a video.</p>
      <p>All through training, the instructors had said that you couldnâ€™t know what youâ€™d do until the moment came. Killing another human being was hard. Some people couldnâ€™t. The perpâ€™s gun came around; the gunman dropped the woman and shouted. It turned out that, for Miller at least, it wasnâ€™t all that hard.</p>
      <p>Afterward, heâ€™d been through mandatory counseling. Heâ€™d cried. Heâ€™d suffered the nightmares and the shakes and all the things that cops suffered quietly and didnâ€™t talk about. But even then, it seemed to be happening at a distance, like heâ€™d gotten too drunk and was watching himself throw up. It was just a physical reaction. It would pass.</p>
      <p>The important thing was he knew the answer to the question. Yes, if he needed to, he could take a life.</p>
      <p>It wasnâ€™t until now, walking through the corridors of Eros, that heâ€™d taken joy in it. Even taking down the poor bastard in that first firefight had felt like the sad necessity of work. Pleasure in killing hadnâ€™t come until after Julie, and it wasnâ€™t really pleasure as much as a brief cessation of pain.</p>
      <p>He held the gun low. Holden started down the ramp, and Miller followed, letting the Earther take point. Holden walked faster than he did and with the uncommented athleticism of someone who lived in a wide variety of gravities. Miller had the feeling heâ€™d made Holden nervous, and he regretted that a little. He hadnâ€™t intended to, and he really needed to get aboard Holdenâ€™s ship if he was going to find Julieâ€™s secrets.</p>
      <p>Or, for that matter, not die of radiation sickness in the next few hours. That seemed a finer point than it probably was.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden said at the bottom of the ramp. â€œWe need to get back down, and there are a lot of guards between us and Naomi that are going to be really confused by two guys walking the wrong direction.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s a problem,â€� Miller agreed.</p>
      <p>â€œAny thoughts?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller frowned and considered the flooring. The Eros floors were different than Ceresâ€™. Laminate with flecks of gold.</p>
      <p>â€œTubes arenâ€™t going to be running,â€� he said. â€œIf they are, itâ€™ll be in lockdown mode, where it only stops at the holding pen down in the casino. So thatâ€™s out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaintenance corridor again?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf we can find one that goes between levels,â€� Miller said. â€œMight be a little tricky, but it seems like a better bet than shooting our way past a couple dozen assholes in armor. How long have we got before your friend takes off?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden looked at his hand terminal. The radiation alarm was still deep red. Miller wondered how long those took to reset.</p>
      <p>â€œA little more than two hours,â€� Holden said. â€œShouldnâ€™t be a problem.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLetâ€™s see what we can find,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>&lt; {th=align=“justify”>The corridors nearest the radiation sheltersâ€”the death traps, the incubatorsâ€”had been emptied. Wide passages built to accommodate the ancient construction equipment that had carved Eros into a human habitation were eerie with only Holdenâ€™s and Millerâ€™s footsteps and the hum of the air recyclers. Miller hadnâ€™t noticed when the emergency announcements had stopped, but the absence of them now seemed ominous.</p>
      <p>If it had been Ceres, he would have known where to go, where everything led, how to move gracefully from one stage to another. On Eros, all he had was an educated guess. That wasnâ€™t so bad.</p>
      <p>But he could tell it was taking too long, and worse than thatâ€”they werenâ€™t talking about it; neither one spokeâ€”they were walking more slowly than normal. It wasnâ€™t up to the threshold of consciousness, but Miller knew that both of their bodies were starting to feel the radiation damage. It wasnâ€™t going to get better.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden said. â€œSomewhere around here there has to be a maintenance shaft.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCould also try the tube station,â€� Miller said. â€œThe cars run in vacuum, but there might be some service tunnels running parallel.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t you think theyâ€™d have shut those down as part of the big roundup?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œProbably,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œHey! You two! What the fuck you think youâ€™re doing up here?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller looked back over his shoulder. Two men in riot gear were waving at them menacingly. Holden said something sharp under his breath. Miller narrowed his eyes.</p>
      <p>The thing was these men were amateurs. The beginning of an idea moved in the back of Millerâ€™s mind as he watched the two approach. Killing them and taking their gear wouldnâ€™t work. There was nothing like scorch marks and blood to make it clear something had happened. Butâ€¦</p>
      <p>â€œMiller,â€� Holden said, a warning in his voice.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. â€œI know.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI said what the fuck are you two doing here?â€� one of the security men said. â€œThe stationâ€™s on lockdown. Everyone goes down to the casino level or up to the radiation shelters.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe were just looking for a way toâ€¦ ahâ€¦ get down to the casino level,â€� Holden said, smiling and being nonthreatening. â€œWeâ€™re not from around here, andâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>The closer of the two guards jabbed the butt of his rifle neatly into Holdenâ€™s leg. The Earther staggered, and Miller shot the guard just below the faceplate, then turned to the one still standing, mouth agape.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re Mikey Ko, right?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>The manâ€™s face went even paler, but he nodded. Holden groaned and stood.</p>
      <p>â€œDetective Miller,â€� Miller said. â€œBusted you on Ceres about four years ago. You got a little happy in a bar. Tappanâ€™s, I think? Hit a girl with a pool cue?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOh, hey,â€� the man said with a frightened smile. â€œYeah, I remember you. How you been doing?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood and bad,â€� Miller said. â€œYou know how it is. Give the Earther your gun.â€�</p>
      <p>Ko looked from Miller to Holden and back, licking his lips and judging his chances. Miller shook his head.</p>
      <p>â€œSeriously,â€� Miller said. â€œGive him the gun.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure, yeah. No problem.â€�</p>
      <p>This was the kind of man whoâ€™d killed Julie, Miller thought. Stupid. Shortsighted. A man born with a sense for raw opportunity where his soul should have been. Millerâ€™s mental Julie shook her head in disgust and sorrow, and Miller found himself wondering if she meant the thug now handing his rifle to Holden or himself. Maybe both.</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™s the deal here, Mikey?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat do you mean?â€� the guard said, playing stupid, like they were in an interrogation cell. Stalling for time. Walking through the old script of cop and criminal as if it still made sense. As if everything hadnâ€™t changed. Miller was surprised by a tightness in his throat. He didnâ€™t know what it was there for.</p>
      <p>â€œThe job,â€� he said. â€œWhatâ€™s the job?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Miller said gently. â€œI just killed your buddy.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd thatâ€™s his third today,â€� Holden said. â€œI saw him.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller could see it in the manâ€™s eyes: the cunning, the shift, the move from one strategy to another. It was old and familiar and as predictable as water moving down.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Ko said, â€œitâ€™s just a job. They told us about a year ago how we were making a big move, right? But no one knows what it is. So a few months back, they start moving guys over. Training us up like we were cops, you know?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWho was training you?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œThe last guys. The ones who were working the contract before us,â€� Ko said.</p>
      <p>â€œProtogen?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSomething like that, yeah,â€� he said. â€œThen they took off, and we took over. Just muscle, you know. Some smuggling.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSmuggling what?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAll kinds of shit,â€� Ko said. He was starting to feel safe, and it showed in the way he held himself and the way he spoke. â€œSurveillance equipment, communication arrays, serious-as-fuck servers with their own little gel software wonks already built in. Scientific equipment too. Stuff for checking the water and the air and shit. And these ancient remote-access robots like youâ€™d use in a vacuum dig. All sorts of shit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhere was it going to?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œHere,â€� Ko said, gesturing to the air, the stone, the station. â€œItâ€™s all here. They were like months installing it all. And then for weeks, nothing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat do you mean, nothing?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNothing nothing. All this buildup and then we sat around with our thumbs up our butts.â€�</p>
      <p>Something had gone wrong. The Phoebe bug hadnâ€™t made its rendezvous, but then Julie had come, Miller thought, and the game had turned back on. He saw her again as if he were in her apartment. The long, spreading tendrils of whatever the hell it was, the bone spurs pressing out against her skin, the black froth of filament pouring from her eyes.</p>
      <p>â€œThe payâ€™s good, though,â€� Ko said philosophically. â€œAnd it was kind of nice taking some time off.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded in agreement, leaned close, tucking the barrel of his gun through the interleaving of armor at Koâ€™s belly, and shot him.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat the fuck!â€� Holden said as Miller put his gun into his jacket pocket.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat did you think was going to happen?â€� Miller said, squatting down beside the gut-shot man. â€œItâ€™s not like he was going to let us go.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, okay,â€� Holden said. â€œButâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHelp me get him up,â€� Miller said, hooking an arm behind Koâ€™s shoulder. Ko shrieked when Miller lifted him.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGet his other side,â€� Miller said. â€œMan needs medical attention, right?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUm. Yes,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œSo get his other side.â€�</p>
      <p>It wasnâ€™t as far back to the radiation shelters as Miller had expected, which had its good points and its bad ones. On the upside, Ko was still alive and screaming. The chances were better that heâ€™d be lucid, which wasnâ€™t what Miller had intended. But as they came near the first group of guards, Koâ€™s babbling seemed scattered enough to work.</p>
      <p>â€œHey!â€� Miller shouted. â€œSome help over here!â€�</p>
      <p>At the head of the ramp, four of the guards looked at one another and then started moving toward them, curiosity winning out over basic operating procedures. Holden was breathing hard. Miller was too. Ko wasnâ€™t that heavy. It was a bad sign.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat the hell is this?â€� one of the guards said.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s a bunch of people holed up back there,â€� Miller said. â€œResistance. I thought you people swept this level.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat wasnâ€™t our job,â€� the guy said. â€œWeâ€™re just making sure the groups from the casino get to the shelters.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWell, someone screwed up,â€� Miller snapped. â€œYou have transport?â€�</p>
      <p>The guards looked at each other again.</p>
      <p>â€œWe can call for one,â€� a guy at the back said.</p>
      <p>â€œNever mind,â€� Miller said. â€œYou boys go find the shooters.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWait a minute,â€� the first guy said. â€œExactly who the hell are you?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe installers from Protogen,â€� Holden said. â€œWeâ€™re replacing the sensors that failed. This guy was supposed to help us.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI didnâ€™t hear about that,â€� the leader said.</p>
      <p>Miller dug a finger under Koâ€™s armor and squeezed. Ko shrieked and tried to writhe away from him.</p>
      <p>â€œTalk to your boss about it on your own time,â€� Miller said. â€œCome on. Letâ€™s get this asshole to a medic.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHold on!â€� the first guard said, and Miller sighed. Four of them. If he dropped Ko and jumped for coverâ€¦ but there wasnâ€™t much cover. And who the hell knew what Holden would do?</p>
      <p>â€œWhere are the shooters?â€� the guard asked. Miller kept himself from smiling.</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s a hole about a quarter klick anti-spinward,â€� Miller said. â€œThe other oneâ€™s bodyâ€™s still there. You canâ€™t miss it.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller turned down the ramp. Behind him, the guards were talking among themselves, debating what to do, who to call, who to send.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re completely insane,â€� Holden said over Koâ€™s semiconscious waid  {nsceeping.</p>
      <p>Maybe he was right.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>When, Miller wondered, does someone stop being human? There had to be a moment, some decision that you made, and before it, you were one person, and after it, someone else. Walking down through the levels of Eros, Koâ€™s bleeding body slung between him and Holden, Miller reflected. He was probably dying of radiation damage. He was lying his way past half a dozen men who were only letting him by because they were used to people being scared of them and he wasnâ€™t. He had killed three people in the last two hours. Four if he counted Ko. Probably safer to say four, then.</p>
      <p>The analytical part of his mind, the small, still voice he had cultivated for years, watched him move and replayed all his decisions. Everything heâ€™d done had made perfect sense at the time. Shooting Ko. Shooting the other three. Leaving the safety of the crewâ€™s hideout to investigate the evacuation. Emotionally, it had all been obvious at the time. It was only when he considered it from outside that it seemed dangerous. If heâ€™d seen it in someone elseâ€”Muss, Havelock, Sematimbaâ€”he wouldnâ€™t have taken more than a minute to realize theyâ€™d gone off the rails. Since it was him, he had taken longer to notice. But Holden was right. Somewhere along the line, heâ€™d lost himself.</p>
      <p>He wanted to think it had been finding Julie, seeing what had happened to her body, knowing he hadnâ€™t been able to save her, but that was only because it seemed like the sentimental moment. The truth was his decisions before thenâ€”leaving Ceres to go on a wild hunt for Julie, drinking himself out of a career, remaining a cop for even a day after that first kill all those years earlierâ€”none of them seemed to make sense, viewed objectively. Heâ€™d lost a marriage to a woman heâ€™d loved once. Heâ€™d lived hip deep in the worst humanity had to offer. Heâ€™d learned firsthand that he was capable of killing another human being. And nowhere along the line could he say that there, at that moment, he had been a sane, whole man, and that afterward, he hadnâ€™t.</p>
      <p>Maybe it was a cumulative process, like smoking cigarettes. One didnâ€™t do much. Five didnâ€™t do much more. Every emotion heâ€™d shut down, every human contact heâ€™d spurned, every love and friendship and moment of compassion from which heâ€™d turned had taken him a degree away from himself. Until now, heâ€™d been able to kill men with impunity. To face his impending death with a denial that let him make plans and take action.</p>
