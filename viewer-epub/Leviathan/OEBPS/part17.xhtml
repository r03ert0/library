      <h2>â€œThose ships donâ€™t make any sense to me, Boss,â€� Alex...</h2>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™ll know they canâ€™t catch us before the Donnager picks us up,â€� Holden said. â€œAnd they canâ€™t take her in a fight. So I donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re up to.â€�</p>
      <p>Amos poured the last of the tequila into everyoneâ€™s cups and held his up in a toast.</p>
      <p>â€œI guess weâ€™ll fucking find out.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Ten: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Captain Shaddid tapped the tip of her middle finger against her thumb when she started getting annoyed. It was a small sound, soft as a catâ€™s paws, but ever since Miller first noticed her habit, it had seemed louder. Quiet as it was, it could fill her office.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller,â€� she said, smiling as if she meant it. â€œWeâ€™re all on edge these days. These have been hard, hard times.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes, sir,â€� Miller said, lowering his head like a fullback determined to muscle his way through all defenders, â€œbut I think this is important enough to deserve closerâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s a favor for a shareholder,â€� Shaddid said. â€œHer father got jumpy. Thereâ€™s no reason to think he meant Mars blasting the Canterbury. Tariffs are going up again. There was a mine blowout on one of the Red Moon operations. Eros is having trouble with their yeast farm. We donâ€™t go through a day without something happening in the Belt that would make a daddy scared for his precious little flower.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes, sir, but the timingâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>Her fingers upped tempo. Miller bit his lips. The cause was lost.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t go chasing conspiracies,â€� Shaddid said. â€œWeâ€™ve got a full board of crimes we know are real. Politics, war, system-wide cabals of inner planet bad guys searching for ways to screw us over? Not our mandate. Just get me a report that says youâ€™re looking, Iâ€™ll send it back up the line, and we can get back to our jobs.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes, sir.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnything else?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, sir.â€�</p>
      <p>Shaddid nodded and turned back to her terminal. Miller plucked his hat from the corner of her desk and headed out. One of the station house air filters had gone bad over the weekend, and the replacement gave the rooms a reassuring smell of new plastic and ozone. Miller sat at his desk, fingers laced behind his head, and stared at the light fixture above him. The knot that had tied itself in his gut hadnâ€™t loosened up. That was too bad.</p>
      <p>â€œNot so good, then?â€� Havelock asked.</p>
      <p>â€œCould have gone better.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShe pull the job?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shook his head. â€œNo, itâ€™s still mine. She just wants me to do it half-assed.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCould be worse. At least you get to find out what happened. And if you maybe spend a little time after hours digging into it just for practice, you know?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said. â€œPractice.â€�</p>
      <p>Their desks were unnaturally clean, his and Havelockâ€™s both. The barrier of paperwork Havelock had created between himself and the station had eroded away, and Miller could tell from his partnerâ€™s eyes and the way his hands moved that the cop in Havelock wanted to get back into the tunnels. He couldnâ€™t tell if it was to prove himself before his transfer went through, or just to break a few heads. Maybe those were two ways of saying the same thing.</p>
      <p>Just donâ€™t get yourself killed before you get out of here, Miller thought. Aloud, he said, â€œWhat have we got?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHardware shop. Sector eight, third level in,â€� Havelock said. â€œExtortion complaint.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller sat for a moment, considering his own reluctance as if it belonged to someone else. It was like Shaddid had given a dog just one bite of fresh meat, then pointed it back toward kibble. The temptation to blow off the hardware shop bloomed, and for a moment he almost gave in. Then he sighed, swung his feet down to the decking, and stood.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right, then,â€� he said. â€œLetâ€™s go make the station safe for commerce.â€�&lt; said.erc/p></p>
      <p>â€œWords to live by,â€� Havelock said, checking his gun. Heâ€™d been doing that a lot more recently.</p>
      <p>The shop was an entertainment franchise. Clean white fixtures offering up custom rigs for interactive environments: battle simulations, exploration games, sex. A womanâ€™s voice ululated on the sound system, somewhere between an Islamic call to prayer and orgasm with a drumbeat. Half the titles were in Hindi with Chinese and Spanish translations. The other half were English with Hindi as the second language. The clerk was hardly more than a boy. Sixteen, seventeen years old with a weedy black beard he wore like a badge.</p>
      <p>â€œCan I help you?â€� the boy said, eying Havelock with disdain just short of contempt. Havelock pulled his ID, making sure the kid got a good long look at his gun when he did it.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™d like to talk toâ€�â€”Miller glanced at the complaint form on his terminal screenâ€”â€œAsher Kamamatsu. He here?â€�</p>
      <p>The manager was a fat man, for a Belter. Taller than Havelock, the man carried fat around his belly and thick muscles through the shoulders, arms, and neck. If Miller squinted, he could see the seventeen-year-old boy he had been under the layers of time and disappointment, and it looked a lot like the clerk out front. The office was almost too small for the three of them and stacked with boxes of pornographic software.</p>
      <p>â€œYou catch them?â€� the manager said.</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Miller said. â€œStill trying to figure out who they are.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDammit, I already told you. Thereâ€™s pictures of them off the store camera. I gave you his fucking name.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller looked at his terminal. The suspect was named Mateo Judd, a dockworker with an unspectacular criminal record.</p>
      <p>â€œYou think itâ€™s just him, then,â€� Miller said. â€œAll right. Weâ€™ll just go pick him up, throw him in the can. No reason for us to find out who heâ€™s working for. Probably no one whoâ€™ll take it wrong, anyway. My experience with these protection rackets, the purse boys get replaced whenever one goes down. But since youâ€™re sure this guyâ€™s the whole problemâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>The managerâ€™s sour expression told Miller heâ€™d made his point. Havelock, leaning against a stack of boxes marked , smiled.</p>
      <p>â€œWhy donâ€™t you tell me what he wanted,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œI already told the last cop,â€� the manager said.</p>
      <p>â€œTell me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe was selling us a private insurance plan. Hundred a month, same as the last guy.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLast guy?â€� Havelock said. â€œSo this happened before?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure,â€� the manager said. â€œEveryone has to pay some, you know. Price of doing business.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller closed his terminal, frowning. â€œPhilosophical. But if itâ€™s the price of doing business, whatâ€™re we here for?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBecause I thought youâ€¦ you people had this shit under control. Ever since we stopped paying the Loca, Iâ€™ve been able to turn a decent profit. Now itâ€™s all starting up again.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHold on,â€� Miller said. â€œYouâ€™re telling me the Loca Greiga stopped charging protection?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure. Not just here. Half of the guys I know in"justiI k the Bough just stopped showing up. We figured the cops had actually done something for once. Now weâ€™ve got these new bastards, and itâ€™s the same damn thing all over again.â€�</p>
      <p>A crawling feeling made its way up Millerâ€™s neck. He looked up at Havelock, who shook his head. He hadnâ€™t heard of it either. The Golden Bough Society, Sohiroâ€™s crew, the Loca Greiga. All the organized crime on Ceres suffering the same ecological collapse, and now someone new moving into the evacuated niche. Might be opportunism. Might be something else. He almost didnâ€™t want to ask the next questions. Havelock was going to think he was paranoid.</p>
      <p>â€œHow long has it been since the old guys called on you for protection?â€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know. Long time.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBefore or after Mars killed that water hauler?â€�</p>
      <p>The manager folded his thick arms; his eyes narrowed.</p>
      <p>â€œBefore,â€� he said. â€œMaybe a month or two. Sâ€™that got to do with anything?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJust trying to get the time scale right,â€� Miller said. â€œThe new guy. Mateo. He tell you who was backing his new insurance plan?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s your job, figuring it. Right?â€�</p>
      <p>The managerâ€™s expression had closed down so hard Miller imagined he could hear the click. Yes, Asher Kamamatsu knew who was shaking him down. He had balls enough to squeak about it but not to point the finger.</p>
      <p>Interesting.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, thanks for that,â€� Miller said, standing up. â€œWeâ€™ll let you know what we find.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGlad youâ€™re on the case,â€� the manager said, matching sarcasm for sarcasm.</p>
      <p>In the exterior tunnel, Miller stopped. The neighborhood was at the friction point between sleazy and respectable. White marks showed where graffiti had been painted over. Men on bicycles swerved and weaved, foam wheels humming on the polished stone. Miller walked slowly, his eyes on the ceiling high above them until he found the security camera. He pulled up his terminal, navigated to the logs that matched the camera code, and cross-referenced the time code from the storeâ€™s still frames. For a moment, he thumbed the controls, speeding people back and forth. And there was Mateo, coming out of the shop. A smug grin deformed the manâ€™s face. Miller froze the image and enhanced it. Havelock, watching over his shoulder, whistled low.</p>
      <p>The split circle of the OPA was perfectly clear on the thugâ€™s armbandâ€”the same kind of armband heâ€™d found in Julie Maoâ€™s hole.</p>
      <p>What kind of company have you been keeping, kid? Miller thought. Youâ€™re better than this. You have to know youâ€™re better than this.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, partner,â€� he said aloud. â€œThink you can write up the report on that interview? Iâ€™ve got something Iâ€™d like to do. Might not be too smart to have you there. No offense.â€�</p>
      <p>Havelockâ€™s eyebrows crawled toward his hairline.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re going to question the OPA?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShake some trees, is all,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Miller would have thought that just being a security contractor in a known OPA-convivial bar wouleing a bad be enough to get him noticed. In the event, half the faces he recognized in the dim light of John Rock Gentlemenâ€™s Club were normal citizens. More than one of those were Star Helix, just like him, when they were on duty. The music was pure Belter, soft chimes accompanied by zither and guitar with lyrics in half a dozen languages. He was on his fourth beer, two hours past the end of his shift, and on the edge of giving up his plan as a losing scheme when a tall, thin man sat down at the bar next to him. Acne-pocked cheeks gave a sense of damage to a face that otherwise seemed on the verge of laughter. It wasnâ€™t the first OPA armband heâ€™d seen that night, but it was worn with an air of defiance and authority. Miller nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œI heard youâ€™ve been asking about the OPA,â€� the man said. â€œInterested in joining up?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller smiled and lifted his glass, an intentionally noncommittal gesture.</p>
      <p>â€œYou who Iâ€™d talk to if I did?â€� he asked, his tone light.</p>
      <p>â€œMight be able to help.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe you could tell me about a couple other things, then,â€� he said, taking out his terminal and putting it on the fake bamboo bar with an audible click. Mateo Juddâ€™s picture glowed on the screen. The OPA man frowned, turning the screen to see it better.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m a realist,â€� Miller said. â€œWhen Chucky Snails was running protection, I wasnâ€™t above talking to his men. When the Hand took over and then the Golden Bough Society after them. My job isnâ€™t to stop people from bending the rules, itâ€™s to keep Ceres stable. You understand what Iâ€™m saying?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI canâ€™t say I do,â€� the pock-marked man said. His accent made him sound more educated than Miller had expected. â€œWho is this man?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHis nameâ€™s Mateo Judd. Heâ€™s been starting a protection business in sector eight. Says itâ€™s backed by the OPA.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPeople say things, Detective. It is Detective, isnâ€™t it? But you were discussing realism.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf the OPAâ€™s making a move on the Ceres black economy, itâ€™s going to be better all around if we can talk to each other. Communicate.â€�</p>
      <p>The man chuckled and pushed the terminal back. The bartender paced by, a question in his eyes that wasnâ€™t asking if they needed anything. It wasnâ€™t meant for Miller.</p>
      <p>â€œI had heard that there was a certain level of corruption in Star Helix,â€� the man said. â€œI admit Iâ€™m impressed by your straightforward manner. Iâ€™ll clarify. The OPA isnâ€™t a criminal organization.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œReally? My mistake. I figured from the way it killed a lot of peopleâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re baiting me. We defend ourselves against people who are perpetrating economic terrorism against the Belt. Earthers. Martians. We are in the business of protecting Belters,â€� the man said. â€œEven you, Detective.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEconomic terrorism?â€� Miller said. â€œThat seems a little overheated.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou think so? The inner planets look on us as their labor force. They tax us. They direct what we do. They enforce their laws and ignore ours in the name of stability. In the last year, theyâ€™ve doubled the tariffs to Titania. Five thousand people on an ice ball orbiting Neptune, months from anywhere. The sunâ€™s just a bright star to them. Do you think theyâ€™re in a position to get redress? Theyâ€™ve blocked any Belter freighters from taking Europa contracts. They charge us twice as much torom tas m dock at Ganymede. The science station on Phoebe? We arenâ€™t even allowed to orbit it. There isnâ€™t a Belter in the place. Whatever they do there, we wonâ€™t find out until they sell the technology back to us, ten years from now.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller sipped his beer and nodded toward his terminal.</p>
      <p>â€œSo this one isnâ€™t yours?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo. He isnâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller nodded and put the terminal back in his pocket. Oddly, he believed the man. He didnâ€™t hold himself like a thug. The bravado wasnâ€™t there. The sense of trying to impress the world. No, this man was certain and amused and, underneath it all, profoundly tired. Miller had known soldiers like that, but not criminals.</p>
      <p>â€œOne other thing,â€� Miller said. â€œIâ€™m looking for someone.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnother investigation?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot exactly, no. Juliette Andromeda Mao. Goes by Julie.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShould I know the name?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSheâ€™s OPA,â€� Miller said with a shrug.</p>
      <p>â€œDo you know everyone in Star Helix?â€� the man said, and when Miller didnâ€™t answer, he added, â€œWe are considerably larger than your corporation.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFair point,â€� Miller said. â€œBut if you could keep an ear out, Iâ€™d appreciate it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know that youâ€™re in a position to expect favors.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo harm asking.â€�</p>
      <p>The pock-faced man chuckled, put a hand on Millerâ€™s shoulder.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t come back here, Detective,â€� he said, and walked away into the crowd.</p>
      <p>Miller took another drink of his beer, frowning. An uncomfortable feeling of having made the wrong step fidgeted in the back of his mind. Heâ€™d been sure that the OPA was making a move on Ceres, capitalizing on the death of the water hauler and the Beltâ€™s uptick in fear and hatred of the inner planets. But how did that fit with Julie Maoâ€™s father and his suspiciously well-timed anxiety? Or the disappearance of Ceres Stationâ€™s supply of usual suspects in the first place? Thinking about it was like watching a video that was just out of focus. The sense of it was almost there, but only almost.</p>
      <p>â€œToo many dots,â€� Miller said. â€œNot enough lines.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œExcuse me?â€� the bartender said.</p>
      <p>â€œNothing,â€� Miller said, pushing the half-empty bottle across the bar. â€œThanks.â€�</p>
      <p>In his hole, Miller turned on some music. The lyrical chants that Candace had liked, back when they were young and, if not hopeful, at least more joyful in their fatalism. He set the lights to half power, hoping that if he relaxed, if for just a few minutes he let go of the gnawing sense that he had missed some critical detail, the missing piece might arrive on its own.</p>
      <p>Heâ€™d half expected Candace to appear in his mind, sighing and looking crossly at him the way she had in life. Instead, he found himself talking with Julie Mao. In the half sleep of alcohol and exhaustion, he imagined her sitting at Havelockâ€™s desk. She was the wrong age, younger than the real woman would be. She was the age of the smiling kid in her picture. The girl who had raced in the Razorback and won. He had the sense of asking her questions, and her answers had the power of revelation. Everything made sense. Not only the change in f revehanthe Golden Bough Society and her own abduction case, but Havelockâ€™s transfer, the dead ice hauler, Millerâ€™s own life and work. He dreamed of Julie Mao laughing, and he woke up late, with a headache.</p>
      <p>Havelock was waiting at his desk. His broad, short Earther face seemed strangely alien, but Miller tried to shake it off.</p>
      <p>â€œYou look like crap,â€� Havelock said. â€œBusy night?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJust getting old and drinking cheap beer,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>One of the vice squad shouted something angry about her files being locked again, and a computer tech scuttled across the station house like a nervous cockroach. Havelock leaned closer, his expression grave.</p>
      <p>â€œSeriously, Miller,â€� Havelock said. â€œWeâ€™re still partners, andâ€¦ honest to God, I think you may be the only friend Iâ€™ve got on this rock. You can trust me. If thereâ€™s anything you want to tell me, Iâ€™m good.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s great,â€� Miller said. â€œBut I donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking about. Last night was a bust.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo OPA?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSure, OPA. Anymore, you swing a dead cat in this station, youâ€™ll hit three OPA guys. Just no good information.â€�</p>
