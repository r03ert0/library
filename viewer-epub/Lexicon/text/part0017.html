			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Word filtered around that Kerry had won New Hampshire. He was going to be the Democrat nominee for president. “There it is,” said Sashona. She played with the end of her beaded dreadlocks. “Four more years of Bush.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily sat in the back row. She didn’t join in these discussions. She was kind of a loner.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why would we back Bush?” argued a boy. “Kerry’s pro-media; he’ll be better for us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">Because Bush is polarizing</em>, thought Emily. “Because Bush is polarizing,” Sashona said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She had sixteen classes per week. In between, she was expected to study and practice. Not on other students. That was a rule. Her first day, wearing a uniform that still smelled of the plastic wrapping, she’d stood in Charlotte’s office and taken a lecture. There were many rules, and Charlotte took her through each of them, patiently and in detail, like Emily was retarded. At first Emily thought this was because Charlotte was carrying a grudge, but as the lecture wore on, she realized no. Charlotte just thought she was that stupid.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This is a nonnegotiable rule of the school,” Charlotte said. “Indeed, of the organization as a whole. Should you break it, there will be no excuses. No second chances. Am I making myself clear?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re making yourself clear,” Emily said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At this point, she didn’t know what <em class="calibre1">practicing</em> meant. It took her months to find out. She thought they were going to teach her persuasion; instead, she got philosophy, psychology, sociology, and the history of language. Back in San Francisco, Lee had given her a little speech about how this school would be different because it taught interesting, useful things, and that was a joke, in Emily’s opinion. Grammar was not interesting. It was not useful to know where words came from. And no one explained it. There was no overview. No road map. Classes were eight to twelve students of wildly different ages, all of them ahead of Emily and no one asking the obvious questions. She had to stay up at night, staring at textbooks, trying to figure out why any of this mattered.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She learned Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which was the order in which people optimally satisfied different types of desires (food-safety-love-status-enlightenment). She learned that leverage over people’s desire for knowledge was called <em class="calibre1">informational social influence</em>, while leverage over people’s desire to be liked was <em class="calibre1">normative social influence</em>. She learned that you could classify a person’s personality into one of 228 psychographic categories with a small number of well-directed questions plus observation, and this was called <em class="calibre1">segmentation</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I thought this was going to be cooler,” she complained to Eliot. He was a part-time lecturer, teaching a few advanced classes, which did not include her. Whenever she saw his car parked out front, she headed for his office, because he was the only one she could talk to. “I thought it would be like magic.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot was busy with papers. But she figured he had an obligation to deal with her, since it was basically his fault she was here. “Sorry,” he said. “At your level, it’s just books.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When is it like magic?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When you finish the books,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">By the end of the year, she could see where it was going. She wasn’t learning persuasion, was still deep in Plato and neurolinguistics and the political roots of the Russian Revolution, but she was starting to sense the connections between them. One day she got to dissect a human brain, and as she peered through goggles at a frontal lobe, sliding the scalpel through the meat, separating decision making from motor function, memory from reward centers, she thought, <em class="calibre1">Hello</em>. Because she knew what the meat did.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She played soccer. You had to do a sport, soccer or basketball or water polo, and she was short and hated the swimsuits, so, soccer. On Wednesday afternoons she lined up with the other girls, shin guards stuffed into knee-high purple socks, her hair dragged back, a yellow shirt billowing, and she chased a ball around a field. The girls were all ages, so it was mostly an exercise in kicking the ball to the oldest and shouting encouragement. The exception was Sashona, who was only Emily’s age but strong and graceful and had shoulders like battering rams. Soccer was supposed to be noncontact but Sashona’s shoulders would put you on your ass anyway. After a goal, she would pump her fist, unsmiling, like she was satisfied but not surprised, and although Emily didn’t enjoy soccer much, she found this terribly impressive. She wanted to be as good at something as Sashona was at soccer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At night, she sat by the window of her cloister room, books piled on her desk. She studied with her hair pinned up and her school tie slung. She didn’t really enjoy reading but she liked how the books were clues. Each one a piece in a puzzle. Even when they didn’t fit together, they revealed a little more about what kind of picture she was making.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One day, exploring a corridor she’d always assumed went nowhere, she discovered a secret library. She didn’t know if it was actually secret. But it wasn’t marked, and she never saw anyone else. It was very small, with shelves that stretched up so high she needed a wooden ladder to reach them. Up there, the books were old. The first time she cracked open a volume, its pages came apart in her hands. After that, she was more careful. It occurred to her that maybe she was not allowed here, but that had not been included in Charlotte’s comprehensive list of rules, and the old books turned out to be interesting, so she stayed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One shelf was for disaster stories. There was probably a classification scheme she hadn’t figured out. But the common thread seemed to be that a lot of people died. After a few books, she realized they were all the same story. They were set in different places, in Sumeria and Mexico and countries she’d never heard of, and the details differed, but the basics were the same. A group of people—sometimes they were called sorcerers, and sometimes demons, and sometimes they were just ordinary people—ruled over a kingdom or nation or whatever. In four of the books, they began building something impressive, like a crystal palace or the world’s largest pyramid. Then something bad happened and people died and everyone started speaking different languages. This story felt vaguely familiar to Emily, but she didn’t place it until she came to a book in which the impressive thing was a tower named Babel.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She thought she heard a noise and froze. But it was far away. She suddenly saw herself: sitting on the floor of a library in a blazer and pleated skirt, navy ribbons in her hair, reading old books. Before she had come here, Emily had seen girls like this—girls who wore ribbons, and enjoyed books—and thought they were a different species. She had thought they were separated by walls. Yet here she was, on the other side, and she didn’t know how she had done it. She didn’t feel like a different person. She was just in a different place.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The junior dining hall made excellent chocolate milk shakes. Emily got into the habit of swinging by after Macroeconomics and carrying one out to a sunny spot on the grass at the side of the building, where she could read. The cup was comically big. She always felt a little sick at the end of it. But she kept going back.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One day she passed a boy with a laptop at one of the outdoor tables. She had seen this boy in the halls, but they didn’t share any classes because he was older. He was more advanced. She snuck a glance at him, and another, because he was pretty cute.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next day he was there again, and this time he looked up as she passed. His eyes took in her enormous milk shake. She kept walking to her sunny spot but couldn’t concentrate on her book.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The day after that, he saw her coming, stretched, and pushed the hair out of his eyes. “Thirsty, huh?” She smiled, because she had been thinking of saying something, and the something was <em class="calibre1">Boy am I thirsty!</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah,” she said. “I am thirsty.” She walked on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On Wednesday, she bought an extra milk shake and deposited it on his table. His eyes, gray and soft as pillows, registered surprise. “I thought you looked thirsty, too.” She walked away, pleased with herself.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On Thursday she brought him no drink. She had thought about this. She simply walked by. There was a terrible moment when she thought he wouldn’t say anything—maybe he was too engrossed in his computer and hadn’t even noticed her. Should she circle around again, or was that too humiliating?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hey, wait,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stopped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thanks for the shake yesterday.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No problem.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stayed, smiling, hoping it wasn’t over. </p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ve never been a milk shake guy. But they’re good.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re better than good,” she said. “I’m addicted.” She sucked at her straw.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He leaned back. “Do you want to sit?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have a bunch of reading to do. Thanks, though. Maybe another time.” She walked away. He didn’t try to stop her, which was a little disappointing, and he didn’t seek her out later, either. But that was okay. She was playing a long game. It was naughty. What she was doing was <em class="calibre1">practicing</em>. Trying to persuade another student. But only a little, nothing she’d get in trouble for. The fact was, if you paid attention, people tried to persuade each other all the time. It was all they did.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next day, she headed for her sunny spot with no milk shake. Her heart thumped, because if he saw this and didn’t respond, she would look pitiful. But she rounded the corner and his computer was closed and on the table were two milk shakes. He smiled, and gestured for her to sit, and she did.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">His name was Jeremy Lattern. He had wanted to be a zookeeper. His family had a tiny house in Brooklyn but his mother rescued animals: rabbits and mice and ducks and dogs and two chickens. One of the chickens was insane. It ran in circles, making noises like it was drowning. His parents had wanted to get rid of it, but Jeremy pleaded for mercy. He thought he could cure it. He imagined this chicken becoming his friend, and people saying, “Jeremy’s the only one who can go near that chicken.” But this never happened. One day the chicken attacked him, pecking his face, and his father wrung its neck. That was how he got the small scar near his left eye, and decided against zoology.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily told him that her family were Canadian and she was raised on hockey. She described how when she was six, her father took her to a game and she was terrified because the crowd was so angry. There was an incident, a splash of players on the ice, and she turned to her father for protection but his face was monstrous. On the way home, he asked if she’d had fun, and she said yes, but whenever she even saw hockey on TV, she felt sick.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">These were all lies, of course. You couldn’t tell a student anything true about yourself. This wasn’t a rule, exactly; it was obvious. She was in her second year and learning how people could be categorized into distinct psychographic groups based on how their brain worked. Segment 107, for example, was an intuition- and fear-motivated introvert personality: Those people made decisions based on avoiding the worst outcomes, found primary colors reassuring, and, when asked to pick a random number, would choose something small, which felt less vulnerable. If you knew someone was a 107, you knew how to persuade them—or, at least, which persuasion techniques were more likely to work. This was not very different from what Emily had always done, without thinking about it too much: You developed a sense of what a mark desired or feared and used that to compel them. It was the same, only with more theory. So that was why you shouldn’t talk about yourself, and why the older students were so aloof and inscrutable: to avoid being identified. To guard against persuasion, you had to hide who you were. But she suspected she was not very good at this. She guessed there were a whole bunch of clues she was inadvertently dropping to someone like Jeremy Lattern every time she opened her mouth, or cut her hair, or chose a sweater. She figured the reason the school had a <em class="calibre1">no practicing</em> rule was that sometimes people did it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">“Tell me what they teach you,” she said. “Give me a sneak preview.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They were making slushies. They had progressed beyond milk shakes. The advantage of the slushie was you had to leave school grounds. Tuesdays and Fridays, if the weather was clear, they walked the three-quarters of a mile to the nearest 7-Eleven. She liked walking beside Jeremy Lattern, because cars would zoom by and the drivers would probably assume she was his girlfriend.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You use very direct language,” he said. “You don’t ask. You command. That’s a useful instinct.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So tell me why I’m learning Latin.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can’t.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you always follow the rules?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Bah,” she said, defeated.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The rules are important. What they teach us is dangerous.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What they teach <em class="calibre1">you</em> is dangerous. What they teach <em class="calibre1">me</em> is Latin. Dude, I’m not asking for state secrets. Just give me something. One thing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He attached the slushie lid and poked the straw through the plastic.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Bah,” she said again. They walked to the front of the store and stood in line behind a kid paying for gas. The man behind the counter was balding, in his fifties, Pakistani or something like it. She nudged Jeremy. “Which segment is this guy?” He didn’t answer. “I’m thinking one eighteen. Am I right? Come on, I’m doing segmentation; you can answer the question.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Maybe one seventy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She hadn’t considered that one, but saw instantly how it made sense. “See, that wasn’t so bad. Now what? What do we do once we know he’s a one seventy?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We pay for our slushies,” Jeremy said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She hung with Jeremy in his room sometimes. Once she stuck chewing gum into the lock before she left and came back when she knew he had a class. She went to his bookshelf and pulled down three titles she had been eyeing for a while. She was sitting on his bed, deep in <em class="calibre1">Sociographic Methods</em>, when the door opened. Jeremy stood there, one hand on the knob. She had never seen him mad before. “Give me that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.” She sat on it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you know what they’ll do—” He tried to grab it and she resisted and he landed on top of her. This she slightly engineered. His breath brushed her face. She let the textbook slide out and clunk to the floor. He raised a hand and it hovered a moment, then came down on her breast. She inhaled. He moved his hand away.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Keep going,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can’t.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes you can.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He rolled off. “It’s not allowed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Come <em class="calibre1">on</em>,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re not allowed to be together.” That was a rule. Fraternization. “It’s not safe.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“For who?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Either of us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stared at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shuffled closer. She touched his white shirt. She had spent a lot of time imagining taking off this shirt. “I won’t tell anyone.” She stroked his chest through the fabric. Then his hand closed on hers.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">“What’s with the fraternization rule?” she asked Eliot. She wandered about his office, fingering books, being casual. Eliot looked up from his papers. Originally, Emily had been going to ask, <em class="calibre1">Why can’t we have sex</em>. Because, just once, she would like to see Eliot surprised or offended. Or anything, really. Just to prove that he was human. But then she lost her nerve.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Students aren’t permitted to enter relationships with each another.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know what it is. I’m asking <em class="calibre1">why</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You know why.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She sighed. “Because if you let someone know you well, they can persuade you. But that’s incredibly cold, Eliot.” She went to the window. Outside, she watched a sparrow hop across the slate roof. “That’s no way to live.” He didn’t reply. “Are you saying, for the rest of my life, I can’t have a relationship with an organization person?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you appreciate how dull that is?” Eliot didn’t react. “And what about . . . you know, purely physical relationships?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s no different.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s completely different. Relationships, okay, I get it. But not for just sex.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There is no ‘just sex.’ It’s called intimacy for a reason.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s one word,” she protested. “Coincidence.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“‘And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain.’ Note the use of the word <em class="calibre1">knew</em> in this context.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s from three thousand years ago. You’re talking about the Bible.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Exactly. The concept is not new.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head, frustrated. “Have you ever done it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Done what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Broken the rule,” she said. “Fraternized.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t believe you.” She did. She was just pushing. “You must have thought about it. What about with Charlotte? There’s something going on with you guys. Your feet always point toward her. And she goes very still around you. It’s like when we’re acting up in class and she’s trying not to get pissed. She goes still when she’s trying to control her emotions.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I need to get some work done, if you don’t mind.” He sounded completely unruffled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think Charlotte wants to fraternize with you,” Emily said. “Badly.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Out.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m going!” She left. She was more frustrated than ever.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She turned eighteen. She lay in bed awhile, thinking about what that meant. Anything? She got up and went to class and of course nobody knew. At lunch, she walked to the 7-Eleven with Jeremy and debated telling him the whole way. Finally, while filling her slushie, she said, “I’m eighteen today.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked surprised. This was the kind of information you were not supposed to share. “I didn’t get you anything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know. I just wanted to tell you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He was silent. They walked to the front of the store. She smiled at the man behind the counter. “It’s my birthday today.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh my goodness.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Finally free.” She leaned across the counter, grinning. “Free to give a long and happy life.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I tell you what,” he said. “I give you the slushie for free.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, no,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Happy birthday.” He pushed it across to her. “You are a good girl.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As they left the store, Jeremy seized her arm. “‘<em class="calibre1">Give a happy life? Finally free?</em>’”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She smiled, but he was serious. He steered her to a bench beside the road and sat her on it and stood there, glowering. She felt a tickle in her stomach, simultaneously sickening and thrilling. “You can’t do that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I got a slushie. One free slushie.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s a serious breach of the rules.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Come on. Like <em class="calibre1">word suggestion</em> is even a real technique. I bet it’s nothing compared to what you can do.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s not the point.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is this because he gave me a present and you didn’t?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You think the rules don’t apply to you? They do. You can’t practice. Not outside the school. Not on that guy. Not on me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You? When have I ever practiced on you?” She poked him with her shoe. “As if I could compromise you. You’re going to graduate next year and I don’t know anything. Come on. Sit. Drink slushie. It’s my birthday.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Promise me you’ll never do that again.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay. <em class="calibre1">Okay</em>, Jeremy. I was just playing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After a while, he sat. She leaned her head on his shoulder. She felt very close to him. “I promise not to turn you into my thought slave,” she said, and felt him smile a little. But she had thought about it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The next Tuesday, she hung around the school gates but Jeremy didn’t show up for their slushie run. She trudged back to the school. Something must have come up. Some class. He was getting busier. But she passed the front lawn and there he was, lounging with his friends, his pant legs rolled up in the sun. They were talking in the way of older students, no one laughing or even moving much, every sentence dripping with irony and layers of meaning, or so Emily guessed. She stopped. Heads turned. Jeremy glanced at her, then away. She walked on.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She understood that they couldn’t be seen together too often. They could not be attached. She knew this. She reached her room and sat at her desk and opened a book. If she turned her head, she could have looked down to the lawn and seen Jeremy and his little group of conceited friends. But she did not. Occasionally she leaned back and stretched her arms, or fiddled with her hair, because she knew he could see her, too.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">From time to time she saw students with ribbons tied around their wrists. The ribbon was red or white; if it was red, it meant a senior taking his final exam. The rule was not to talk to them, or even look too closely, although of course Emily did, because one day she would be wearing that red ribbon, and she wanted to know what that meant. She had once seen a red-ribboned boy building a house of cards in the front hall. He was there for two days, making the house taller and taller while he grew thinner and haunted-looking and it got so that people avoided the hall, in case of drafts. Then one morning the cards were gone and so was the boy. Emily never found out what had happened, whether he passed or failed. Another night, she woke to an odd bell and went to the window to see a girl leading a cow up the driveway. An actual, live cow. Emily could not deduce anything useful from this.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">At the end of her second year, she found a slip of paper beneath her door, notifying her of a room change for Higher-Level Machine Languages. But when she turned up, she was the only student there. The teacher, a short, balding man named Brecht, handed her a white ribbon. “Congratulations. You’re ready for your junior exam.” She tied the ribbon around her left wrist, feeling excited.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Brecht told her to make a computer print the word <em class="calibre1">hello</em> on its screen. This sounded like something she could do in about two minutes, with a command like PRINT or ECHO. But Brecht said not to leave the room until it was done. She sat on a cardboard box, because this was not a classroom so much as a crypt for the corpses of prehistoric computers, and flipped open a laptop.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">So the catch was the laptop didn’t work. She crawled around, testing power supplies and fans. She found a monitor that powered on but had a burned-out VGA input. Everything in the room was like that, she discovered: sabotaged in key ways.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She assembled a machine, Frankenstein-style, from the innards of different devices. It had a hard drive and a monitor and it powered on but wouldn’t do anything else. She had a blinking cursor that refused to respond to the keyboard. The operating system was sabotaged, too.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Her bladder pinged. She had drunk half a bottle of water on her way here, which was unfortunate. Her new goal was to finish this test before she needed to pee into a bag. She uncovered a BIOS problem and then a hole in the boot loader. By the time she got to the operating system, an actual responsive prompt, she knew what she was going to find: All the useful commands were broken. She began searching for bugs. There was one in each level. One deliberate flaw in each layer of software that lay between the screen and the ECHO command. There were so many layers—it was kind of crazy, how much code sat behind ECHO. She hadn’t appreciated that before. There were scripts and libraries and modules and compilers and assembly code, one built on top of the other. Technically, none of it was essential; you could accomplish the same end by manually constructing circuits and moving wires, manipulating pixels one by one. But what the layers did was distill that power into commands. They let you make electrons flow and logic gates close, phosphorous glow and metal magnetize, all by typing words.</p>

			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She finished her silicon monster and went to fetch Brecht. He looked at the HELLO hanging on-screen and nodded once and began to pull her machine apart. She felt a little sad. She was learning that people were just machines and it was working the other way a little, too.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Over the next week, she had to be careful when approaching other students, in case they were wearing a white ribbon. Some students disappeared for days at a time, and some didn’t come back at all, which Emily guessed meant they had failed. She hadn’t really noticed before, because the classes weren’t based on age, but there were more lower-years than seniors. A lot more.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">After exams there were two weeks of vacation, during which most other students went off to their homes. This left Emily with the school to herself, practically. She felt bored and restless and began to hatch plots to break into people’s rooms, so she could learn something. She spent time with one of the few other students to stay over vacation, a doe-eyed girl with dark bangs and a permanent air of disdain. Earlier, Emily had disliked this girl quite a lot, because she was older and spent a lot of time around Jeremy. But now she was basically the only person here who could teach her anything. Emily cut her hair the same and adopted the girl’s walk, which was a kind of drifting, as if she was being blown through corridors on the pages of a million mournful poems. This was not as successful as Emily had hoped, since the doe-eyed girl didn’t open up at all, so Emily was stuck with a dumb haircut for nothing. But she did discover that the girl swam for an hour every day. So Emily snuck into the locker room and stole her key.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The doe-eyed girl’s room was like her own: a single bed, a wooden desk, a chair, and a window looking over the grounds. But her books were completely different. The girl had <em class="calibre1">Persuasion in Middle Europe</em> and <em class="calibre1">Modern Psychographics</em> and a small yellow book Emily had seen seniors carry around and always been intrigued by, titled <em class="calibre1">Gutturals</em>. That one, disappointingly, turned out to be full of word fragments with no explanation or context. But she pulled down a tome with an alluring title, <em class="calibre1">The Linguistics of Magic</em>, and that was better. It was a history lesson about how people had once believed in literal magic, in wizards and witches and spells. They wouldn’t tell strangers their true name, in case the stranger was a sorcerer, because once a sorcerer knew you, he could put you under his power. You had to guard that information. And if you saw someone who looked like a sorcerer, you would avert your eyes and cover your ears before they could compel you. This was where words like <em class="calibre1">charmed</em> came from, and <em class="calibre1">spellbound</em> and <em class="calibre1">fascinated</em> and <em class="calibre1">bewitched</em> and <em class="calibre1">enraptured</em> and <em class="calibre1">compelled</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">This all seemed quaint and amusing, but as the book moved through to the modern day, nothing changed. People still fell to the influence of persuasion techniques, especially when they broadcast information about themselves that allowed identification of their personality type—their true name, basically—and the attack vectors for these techniques were primarily aural and visual. But no one thought of this as magic. It was just falling for a good line or being distracted or clever marketing. Even the words were the same. People still got <em class="calibre1">fascinated</em> and <em class="calibre1">charmed</em>, <em class="calibre1">spellbound</em> and <em class="calibre1">amazed</em>, they <em class="calibre1">forgot themselves</em> and were <em class="calibre1">carried away</em>. They just didn’t think there was anything magical about that anymore.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">When classes resumed, they began to teach her words. No one said what these were for. Charlotte simply handed out envelopes. “Study these in private,” Charlotte told them. “They are not to be shared, ever, with anybody. Repeat them to yourself in front of a mirror, five times per word, every night.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Until when?” asked Sashona, but Charlotte just put on her fake smile, like this was an amusing question.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She took the envelope marked <span class="SCAP1">EMILY RUFF </span>and carried it to her room. Inside were three pieces of paper. <span class="SCAP1">JUSTITRACT. MEGRANCE. VARTIX. </span>They were difficult to read; her brain kept slipping in the wrong direction. They were too similar to real words, maybe. She studied them. She stood in front of the mirror and watched herself. “<em class="calibre1">Varrrrrtttt</em>,” she said, which was supposed to be <em class="calibre1">Vartix</em>, but for some reason it took a long time to come out, time stretching and getting grainy, and not only time but everything: the walls and mirror and air, all undergoing a slow disintegration that she could see and feel with every molecule of her being. She felt fear, because she didn’t want to see what was underneath the world. The sound of her voice fell to pieces and the silence between them froze over. She regained consciousness. She realized this in retrospect. Her fingers and toes tingled. She closed her mouth. There was drool on her chin. She felt bruised in the brain. She walked to her bed and sat. She put the words back in the envelope, because fuck doing that again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But after a while she returned to the mirror. Her mind revolted. It did not want to be bruised again. But she sucked it up. “<em class="calibre1">Varrrrrttt</em>,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">“We got words,” she told Jeremy on the grass. She was being less cautious about being seen with him, because he was graduating soon, and what could they do? “We have to read them to ourselves.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How did that go?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Badly.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He smiled. “Attention words are the worst.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She leaped on this. “Attention words? There are types?” She knew he wouldn’t answer. “What are the others? What are attention words for?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’ll learn soon enough.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I want to know now.” But the truth was, she had just figured it out. <em class="calibre1">Attention words.</em> A single word wasn’t enough. Not even for a particular segment. The brain had defenses, filters evolved over millions of years to protect against manipulation. The first was perception, the process of funneling an ocean of sensory input down to a few key data packages worthy of study by the cerebral cortex. When data got by the perception filter, it received <em class="calibre1">attention</em>. And she saw now that it must be like that all the way down: There must be words to attack each filter. Attention words and then maybe desire words and logic words and urgency words and command words. This was what they were teaching her. How to craft a string of words that would disable the filters one by one, unlocking each mental tumbler until the mind’s last door swung open.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">That night she went to brush her teeth and there was Sashona, wearing blue satin pajamas. “Are you still doing it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Doing what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The words. You know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh. Yeah.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sashona sighed dramatically. “It’s foul, right?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Most foul,” Emily said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There had better be a good reason for it,” Sashona said, pulling back her hair. “Otherwise I’m going to be pissed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily nodded. It seemed pretty obvious to her that the reason was to build up resistance. This term she was taking Drama, puffing herself up and shouting at people in a voice that began in her gut, which the teacher called <em class="calibre1">projecting forcefully</em>. It was all because people were animals, analogue rather than binary, and everything in nature happened in degrees. People could be partially persuaded. They could be shocked into letting down their guard. You practiced saying the words so that if anyone ever said them to you, you would stand a chance.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can’t remember mine,” Sashona said. “They keep falling out of my brain.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sashona left. Emily brushed. Walking back to her room, she heard the TV burbling and saw Sashona in the rec room. She hesitated, thinking about what Sashona had said. About not being able to remember her words. She went to Sashona’s door and tried the handle and it turned.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Sashona’s room was super neat. Emily went to the bookshelf and stood on tiptoe to peer at the books. <em class="calibre1">Socratic Debate</em> was sitting out half an inch, but they hadn’t studied that one for a while. Emily pulled it down, balanced the book on its spine, and let it go. The pages fell open. She saw three slips of paper. Three words.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She closed the book and returned it to the shelf. She was trembling. When she stepped into the corridor she was sure somebody would see her and ask what she was doing. What would she say? She didn’t know. She had no idea. She was just curious.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But there was no one. She closed Sashona’s door and returned to her room. She climbed into bed and lay there, thinking about Sashona’s words.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Over time she found five more sets of words. She didn’t go looking for them, exactly. But if someone left their room unlocked when they went to the bathroom, she would notice that. And she might wander down to that person’s bedroom and see if anything looked like it was hiding words. She didn’t intend to use them for anything. But they were powerful, and they were there, so she looked out for them. She was an opportunist.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was strange how many people left their words in obvious places. She understood that you couldn’t destroy them, because they were slippery in your mind; when she tried to recall one of hers, her brain would offer benign variants, like <em class="calibre1">fairtix</em>, which didn’t mean anything. You needed a permanent record somewhere. But Emily had ripped hers into pieces and numbered them on the back and hidden the code to reassemble them in the margins of different textbooks. Everyone else seemed to have just stuffed them into books and drawers, or under their mattress, or, in one guy’s case, in his pants pocket. She couldn’t understand leaving something lying around that could hurt you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">“I know everything,” she told Jeremy. “I figured it all out. So, good news, I don’t need to pester you with questions anymore.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He glanced at her. He was playing basketball. Or practicing basketball. The indoor court was empty but for them. Jeremy was shooting baskets from the free throw line, over and over. She was watching his shiny shorts.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Once upon a time, there were sorcerers,” she said. “Who were really just guys who knew a little about persuasion. And some of them did all right, ruled kingdoms and founded religions, et cetera, but they also occasionally got burned to death by angry mobs, or beheaded, or drowned while being tested for witchness. So sometime in the last few centuries, maybe even just the last fifty or so, actually, they got organized. To solve the whole being-burned problem. And . . .” She gestured. “Here we are. No more beheadings.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jeremy released the ball. It passed through the net with a <em class="calibre1">swoosh</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Also, the words are getting better,” she said. “I’m thinking that five hundred years ago, the keywords were things like <em class="calibre1">bless</em>. Tribal identifiers. Playing on how we trust people who think like us, believe the same things. Which is a start, but obviously not what <em class="calibre1">you</em> do. It’s not what Eliot and Brontë do. So the organization must have been making keywords. Building them, one on top of the other. Like you do with computer code. First you gain trust from a segment with weak keywords. Not a lot of trust. Just enough to teach them to believe in a stronger keyword. Rinse and repeat.” She sat back on her elbows. “Pretty simple. I actually don’t know why you thought you couldn’t tell me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Have they actually taught you this?” Jeremy said. “Or are you guessing?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ha,” she said. “You just confirmed it. Right there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Bah,” said Jeremy, throwing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They taught me some of it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He came back, bouncing the ball. “What’s a word?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Huh?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re feeling clever—tell me what a word is.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s a unit of meaning.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s meaning?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Uh . . . meaning is an abstraction of characteristics common to the class of objects to which it applies. The meaning of <em class="calibre1">ball</em> is the set of characteristics common to balls, i.e. round and bouncy and often seen around guys in shorts.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jeremy returned to the free throw line, saying nothing. She figured she must have that wrong, or at least not right enough.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You mean from a neurological perspective? Okay. A word is a recipe. A recipe for a particular neurochemical reaction. When I say <em class="calibre1">ball</em>, your brain converts the word into meaning, and that’s a physical action. You can see it happening on an EEG. What we’re doing, or, I should say, what <em class="calibre1">you’re</em> doing, since no one has taught me any good words, is dropping recipes into people’s brains to cause a neurochemical reaction to knock out the filters. Tie them up just long enough to slip an instruction past. And you do <em class="calibre1">that</em> by speaking a string of words crafted for the person’s psychographic segment. Probably words that were crafted decades ago and have been strengthened ever since. And it’s a <em class="calibre1">string</em> of words because the brain has layers of defenses, and for the instruction to get through, they all have to be disabled at once.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Jeremy said, “How do you know this?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you think I’m smart?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think you’re scary,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">While he showered, she waited outside on a wooden bench. From here she had a vantage point across the soccer field to one of the parking lots, the one reserved for teachers, and she saw four black sedans roll up, one after the other. People in suits climbed out. She got off the bench and began to walk over, because this was curious, but one of the men turned to her and she felt very cold and stopped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The people moved inside. She returned to the bench. Jeremy emerged, smelling of soap. “Are you okay?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head. “I saw some people. Poets, I guess.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked at the cars.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“One was an older guy. White hair. Tan skin.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” Jeremy said. “Yeah. That’s Yeats.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The teachers, they’re in there somewhere. You know? They’re brick walls, but you can tell there’s something behind the wall. This guy had shark eyes. Nothing in them. Just . . . eyes.” She shook her head. “Junkies get them, if they’re in a bad place. It freaked me out a little.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Come to my room,” he said. “Hang out.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay.” But she wasn’t ready to move yet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Seriously, don’t worry about Yeats. You’ll never speak to him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why not?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Because he’s a million miles above us,” Jeremy said. “He’s the head of the organization.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Jeremy was going to graduate. She had known it was coming. But he became a senior and she was no longer able to pretend the day belonged in some far-off future. He started begging off slushie runs. He didn’t watch her play soccer anymore. Whenever she knocked on his door he was deep in books, looking tired, making her feel stupid for bothering him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just fail,” she said. “Stay another year. We’d be about the same level. We could even study together.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can’t fail, Emily.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She got off the bed, annoyed, because she had been only joking. Or maybe not, but still. She began sifting through his drawers, looking for anything interesting. But of course there was nothing, because Jeremy Lattern had no personal effects. Certainly no hidden words. She had looked, a couple of times. Just out of interest. It hadn’t always been like this: She remembered a little toy robot with red arms. He had gotten rid of it sometime since she’d met him. That was what people did here. They shrunk and shrunk until there was nothing interesting left.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She went over and put her hands on his shoulders. He tensed. “Relax. It’s a massage. Therapeutic.” She kneaded his muscles until they loosened. When she moved up his neck, he tightened again. “Stop fighting it! I’m helping.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He relaxed. She slid her fingers into his hair. She rubbed his neck with her thumbs. After a while, he put down his pen. It had been a while since he’d turned a page. She ran her fingernails lightly down his back. “Take off your shirt, so I can do your back.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He didn’t respond. She bit her lip. That had been kind of obvious.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can’t focus if you’re tense and distracted. You can’t pretend you’re not made of biology.” She pressed her thumbs into his shoulders. “You have a deficiency need, you satisfy it. That’s Maslow. You can’t move on to higher needs until you satisfy the base ones.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked up at her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She said, “I’d like to have sex with you, if you want.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyes were unreadable. “Okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She smiled, but he didn’t, so she stopped that. He rose from the chair. He looked like he was concentrating on a puzzle. She unbuttoned his shirt. Her fingers shook and he must have noticed. She felt his hands on her waist and she pulled open his shirt and his chest was smooth and hairless and smelled of him in a way that was powerful. She kissed his skin. She craned her neck to reach his lips but he turned his face away. So there was to be no kissing. He removed her jacket. She backed onto the bed and he climbed on top of her. His face betrayed nothing. He was breathing more quickly; that was all. She tried to be like him, not react as his hand moved up her stomach, but a sound came out of her before she could stop it. His eyes flicked at her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m okay.” She pulled him closer. She felt his erection against her and had a moment of panic. She wasn’t a virgin but it had been a long time and everything was different. He continued to press. Her body fizzed with tiny stars and she remembered how this went. She reached down and touched him through his pants and made him grunt. She liked that. She squeezed again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His hand sought admission to her skirt. She lifted her butt, unzipped, and pushed the whole mess of fabric down. His fingers pushed against her and she gave a little gasp. He hesitated. She wanted to grab his hand and force him onto her. She tugged him out of his pants. He buried his face in her shoulder. His fingers found her. It was an awkward angle; she could only squeeze. But the pressure was amazing. Vibration began in her legs. Her teeth chattered. She almost laughed, but that would be no good; she couldn’t do that. He groaned, a low warning, but she ignored it and then he jetted through her fingers. He did it silently. She felt triumphant. The movement of his fingers intensified, and she felt herself going out with the tide of her victory. Her legs kicked once.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She lay still. He panted into her hair. She could smell their sweat. After a minute, he raised his head. She could see the endorphins in his pupils. He rolled away, onto his side. She used a corner of the sheet to clean herself and lay back beside him. He didn’t speak. She watched the ceiling until his breathing eased into a sleep rhythm, about twenty or thirty minutes, and then, when it was safe, she put her arm around him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She went to class the next day and no one knew. It was a secret treasure. She sat in the back row and thought: <em class="calibre1">I had sex with Jeremy Lattern.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was Subvisual Methods, a class she liked, but her mind wandered. At odd times, she seemed to catch his smell. Maybe some of him was still on her. She liked that idea.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A thought popped into her head: <em class="calibre1">He’s a thirteen.</em> She blinked. She didn’t know where that had come from. She had considered Jeremy’s segment before and decided he was probably a ninety-four. His behavior matched up almost perfectly; she’d watched him pretty carefully. But now she felt differently. Ninety-four was a cover. He was a thirteen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">After classes, she decided to fetch him a slushie. He would be studying all afternoon and have no time for her; she knew that. She wouldn’t bother him and wouldn’t expect anything to be different. But she would fetch him a slushie.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">On the way out, she noticed Eliot’s door was open. She hesitated. She hadn’t seen him for months, had been looking forward to his next visit, but right now she should probably avoid him. Because maybe Eliot could tell. But then he came out of his office and it was too late. “Hey!” she said. “Busy? You look busy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. Leaving. But you can walk with me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay.” She fell into step. They walked in silence. She transitioned from being worried that Eliot would figure it out to disappointed that he hadn’t. “How’s life?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How’s life?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Life’s good.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Good.” They passed a group of boys loitering with intent, who straightened and shifted. Eliot was well respected here. It was widely believed that he taught so rarely because he was usually required to be away doing mysterious and badass things. “I was thinking about my name. My poet name, I mean, when I graduate. I decided I want to be Emily Dickinson.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can’t be Dickinson.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I could keep my first name. Also, awesome little poems about death. She’s literally the only poet I don’t hate.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We already have an Emily Dickinson.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Aw.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Also, graduates aren’t given the names of world-renowned poets,” said Eliot. “You’ll be someone you’ve never heard of.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is there a list I can choose from?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You guys are hard-asses.” They reached the front door and descended the steps. “Well, see you round.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He paused. “You’re happier.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You seem happy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shrugged. “It’s a beautiful day, Eliot, what do you want me to say?” He didn’t answer. “You should get out more,” she said. She walked away. He was going to call her back; she could feel it. He would know everything. But he didn’t, and her tension eased, and by the time she reached the gate, she was humming.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She purchased two slushies and almost got hit by a car running across the road while carrying them back. She balanced them in the crook of her arm and knocked on Jeremy’s door. When he called out, she pushed the door open with her hip. “Refreshment!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked at the slushies. He wasn’t as happy as she’d hoped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thank you, Emily,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thanks.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She deposited the slushie on his desk and leaned her butt against the wall. She had intended to give him the drink and go, but now she didn’t want to. “How’s the study going?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Slowly.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She nodded. “I’ll leave you to it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thanks.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Unless you want a study break.” She raised her eyebrows.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That can’t happen again.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What can’t happen?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You know what.” His voice dropped. “We shouldn’t have done it. I shouldn’t have.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, I forgive you.” She tried to keep it light, but her heart was sinking through her stomach. She had seen this coming, hadn’t she? She’d practically provoked it. But now she felt sick.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If they knew, I’d be expelled.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We both would.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes, but . . .” He tapped the books lightly with his fingers. “This is my final exam. I can’t fuck this up.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stared at him.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You understand, right? I have to do this. I’m sorry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you,” she said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think you’re a great person—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She threw her slushie. It exploded on his head, red juice and ice chips flying everywhere, splashing his books and papers. He sat frozen, dripping. She slammed the door on the way out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She had soccer and was in no mood for it. She stood rooted in the defensive half of the field and didn’t chase. Sashona, on the opposing team, concentrated her attacks on Emily’s wing to capitalize on her apathy. Once she ran past while Emily just stood there, and after she scored, she ruffled Emily’s hair.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The next time Sashona pounded toward her, the ball bobbling along in front of her, Emily decided to put Sashona on the ground. She moved to intercept and Sashona’s face hardened in a way that told Emily to expect the shoulders. A word bubbled to Emily’s lips, one of the attention words she had discovered in Sashona’s room. <em class="calibre1">Kassonin.</em> That was the word. It would be enough to kick Sashona in the brain just long enough for Emily to knock her flat, and she would use it because she had <em class="calibre1">not</em> used it on Jeremy, even though she could have, because he was, like Sashona, a thirteen. <em class="calibre1">Kassonin, bitch.</em> Her head was full of blood. <em class="calibre1">Eat MY shoulders.</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They collided. By the time Emily got up, Sashona was jogging back to her half, doing the fist pump. She had scored while Emily was on her ass. “Fuuuck,” Emily said, and Sashona laughed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She had to get away for a while, so instead of changing she headed for the school gate. She was almost there when she heard footsteps. Jeremy was running after her. “Em! Wait!” She didn’t want to, but some small, stupid part of her thought, <em class="calibre1">Maybe he changed his mind</em>. He caught her, breathing fast. He’d showered, put on a fresh shirt. His cheeks were pink. “Let’s not end things this way.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’ve been friends for two years. I don’t—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Gah</em>,” she said, as soon as she heard the word <em class="calibre1">friends</em>. She walked.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He trotted beside her. “You can’t tell anyone.” She didn’t answer. “They will expel you. They’ve done it before. They’ll send you fucking home.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Maybe you made me do it,” she said. “Maybe you took advantage of me, with your words.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stopped. When she reached the gate, he yelled, “<em class="calibre1">How dare you!</em>” She flinched, because there was fury in his voice. She kept walking. She wasn’t going to accuse him of anything, couldn’t he tell that? She just wanted him to feel something. “<em class="calibre1">Come back! Come back here!</em>” The traffic was flowing but she threaded through it to the other side. A van honked. She turned to see Jeremy stranded outside the gates, his face red. “<em class="calibre1">You say nothing!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Make me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stepped onto the road. She was reminded of Benny in San Francisco: how he’d been funny and kind until she pushed him too far. “Stop,” she said. Jeremy knew her. He did know her segment. He was about to graduate and he could make her do whatever he wanted. “I’m sorry! I won’t tell!” He was halfway across, paused between lanes, his face thick with anger. He waited for a car, threw a glance to his right, and ran at her. She screamed, “<em class="calibre1">Kassonin!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His head jerked. He stopped. For a moment he was a child. Then he came back. She saw shock in his eyes and outrage and fear. She was transfixed by his face. Then a car swept him away. She shrieked and couldn’t hear herself over the tires.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She wanted to go to the hospital but they wouldn’t let her. She had to stay in the sitting room, the same place Charlotte had interviewed her when she’d first arrived, curled up in the same armchair.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Finally, Eliot came in, wearing a long coat. She opened her mouth to ask about Jeremy but could see the answer on his face. She covered her face with her hands and cried.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tell me what happened.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head, not looking up. He crossed the rug and lifted her chin. “No,” she said, and tried to cover her ears. He pulled away her hands and spoke and her mind went away. When she returned to herself, he was sitting in the chair across the rug, his eyes dark. She closed her mouth and swallowed. Her throat felt sore.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Your time here is over,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Please don’t send me away. Please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stood. She began to cry again, but there was no pity in his eyes. He left.</p>
