      <h2>â€œSheâ€™s not like us,â€� Amos said, and the warmth and...</h2>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s why I like her,â€� Miller said. It was the right thing to say. Amos nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œSo hereâ€™s the thing. As far as the captain goes, youâ€™re dipped in shit right now.â€�</p>
      <p>The scrim of bubbles where his beer touched the glass glowed white in the dim light. Miller gave the glass a quarter turn, watching them closely.</p>
      <p>â€œBecause I killed someone who needed it?â€� Miller asked. The bitterness in his voice wasnâ€™t surprising, but it was deeper than heâ€™d intended. Amos didnâ€™t hear it or else didnâ€™t care.</p>
      <p>â€œBecause youâ€™ve got a habit of that,â€� Amos said. â€œCapâ€™nâ€™s not like that. Killing people without talking it over first makes him jumpy. You did a lot of it on Eros, butâ€¦ you know.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œThoth Station wasnâ€™t Eros. Next place we go wonâ€™t be Eros either. Holden doesnâ€™t want you around.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd the rest of you?ustif s ofâ€� Miller asked.</p>
      <p>â€œWe donâ€™t want you around either,â€� Amos said. His voice wasnâ€™t hard or gentle. He was talking about the gauge of a machine part. He was talking about anything. The words hit Miller in the belly, just where heâ€™d expected it. He couldnâ€™t have blocked them.</p>
      <p>â€œHereâ€™s the thing,â€� Amos went on. â€œYou and me, weâ€™re a lot the same. Been around. I know what I am, and my moral compass? Iâ€™ll tell you, itâ€™s fucked. A few things fell different when I was a kid. I could have been those ass-bandits on Thoth. I know that. Captain couldnâ€™t have been. Itâ€™s not in him. Heâ€™s as close to righteous as anyone out here gets. And when he says youâ€™re out, thatâ€™s just the way it is, because the way I figure it, heâ€™s probably right. Sure as hell has a better chance than I do.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Amos said. He finished his beer. Then he finished Naomiâ€™s. And then he walked away, leaving Miller to himself and his empty gut. Outside, the Nauvoo fanned a glittering array of sensors, testing something or else just preening. Miller waited.</p>
      <p>Beside him, Julie Mao leaned on the table, just where Amos had been.</p>
      <p>So, she said. Looks like itâ€™s just you and me now.</p>
      <p>â€œLooks like,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Chapter Forty-Three: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>A Tycho worker in blue coveralls and a welding mask sealed up the hole in one of the galley bulkheads. Holden watched with his hand shielding his eyes from the harsh blue glare of the torch. When the plate steel was secured in place, the welder flipped her mask up to check the bead. She had blue eyes and a small mouth in a heart-shaped pixie face and a mop of red hair pulled into a bun. Her name was Sam, and she was the team leader on the Rocinante repair project. Amos had been chasing her for two weeks now with no success. Holden was glad, because the pixie had turned out to be one of the best mechanics heâ€™d ever met, and heâ€™d hate for her to focus on anything other than his ship.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s perfect,â€� he said to her as she ran one gloved hand over the cooling metal.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s okay,â€� she said with a shrug. â€œWeâ€™ll grind this down smooth enough, paint it nice, then youâ€™ll never even know your ship had a boo-boo.â€� She had a surprisingly deep voice that contrasted with her looks and her habit of using mockingly childlike phrases. Holden guessed that her appearance combined with her chosen profession had led to a lot of people underestimating her in the past. He didnâ€™t want to make that mistake.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve done amazing work, Sam,â€� he said. He guessed Sam was short for something, but heâ€™d never asked and sheâ€™d never volunteered. â€œI keep telling Fred how happy we are to have you in charge of this job.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaybe Iâ€™ll get a gold star in my next report card,â€� she said while she put her torch away and stood up. Holden tried to think of something to say to that and failed.</p>
      <p>â€œSorry,â€� she said, turning to face him. â€œI appreciate your praise to the boss. And to be honest, itâ€™s been a lot of fun working on your little girl. Sheâ€™s quite a ship. The beating she took would have blown anything we own into scrap.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt was a close thing, even for us,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>Sam nodded, then began putting the rest of her gear away. As she worked, Naomi climbed down the crew ladder from the upper decks, her gray coveralls hung with electricianâ€™s tools.</p>
      <p>â€œHow are things up there?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œNinety percent,â€� Naomi said as she crossed the galley to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of juice. â€œGive or take.â€� She took out a second bottle and tossed it to Sam, who caught it one-handed.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi,â€� Sam said, raising the bottle in mock toast before downing half of it in one swallow.</p>
      <p>â€œSammy,â€� Naomi said in return with a grin.</p>
      <p>The two of them had hit it off right away, and now Naomi was spending a lot of her off time with Sam and her Tycho crowd. Holden hated to admit it, but he missed being the only social circle Naomi had. When he did admit it to himself, like now, it made him feel like a creep.</p>
      <p>â€œGolgo comp in rec, tonight?â€� Sam said after sheâ€™d gulped down the last of her drink.</p>
      <p>â€œThink those C7 chumps are tired of getting their asses handed to them?â€� Naomi said in return. To Holden, it sounded like they were speaking in code.</p>
      <p>â€œWe can throw the first one,â€� Sam said. â€œGet â€™em hooked tight before we drop the hammer and wipe their roll.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSounds good to me,â€� Naomi said, then tossed her empty bottle into the recycling bin and started back up the ladder. â€œSee you at eight, then.â€� She tossed a little wave at Holden. â€œLater, Captain.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden said, â€œHow much longer, do you think?â€� to Samâ€™s back as she finished with her tools.</p>
      <p>Sam shrugged. â€œCouple days, maybe, to get her to perfect. She could probably fly now, if youâ€™re not worried about nonessentials and cosmetics.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThanks, again,â€� Holden said, holding out his hand to Sam as she turned around. She shook it once, her palm heavily calloused and her grip firm. â€œAnd I hope you mop the floor with those chumps from C7.â€�</p>
      <p>She gave him a predatory grin.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not even in doubt.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Through Fred Johnson, the OPA had provided the crew with living quarters on the station during the renovation of the Roci, and over the past few weeks, Holdenâ€™s cabin had almost come to feel like home. Tycho had money, and they seemed to spend a lot of it on their employees. Holden had three rooms to himself, including a bath and a kitchen nook off the public space. On most stations, youâ€™d have to be the governor to have that kind of luxury. Holden had the impression it was fairly standard for management on Tycho.</p>
      <p>He tossed his grimy jumpsuit into the laundry bin and started a pot of coffee before jumping into his private shower. A shower every night after work: another almost unthinkable luxury. It would be easy to get distracted. To start thinking of this period of ship repair and quiet home life as normalcy, not interlude. Holden couldnâ€™t let that happen.</p>
      <p>Earthâ€™s assault on Mars filled the newsfeeds. The domes of Mars still stood, but two showers of meteors had pocked the wide slopes of Olympus Mons. Earth claimed that it was debris from Deimos, Mars that it was an intentional threat and provocation. Marnal t {iontian ships from the gas giants were burning hard for the inner planets. Every day, every hour brought the moment closer when Earth would have to commit to annihilating Mars or backing away. The OPAâ€™s rhetoric seemed built to ensure that whoever won would kill them next. Holden had just helped Fred with what Earth would see as the largest act of piracy in the history of the Belt.</p>
      <p>And a million and a half people were dying right now on Eros. Holden thought of the video feed heâ€™d seen of what was happening to the people on the station, and shuddered even in the heat of the shower.</p>
      <p>Oh, and aliens. Aliens that had tried to take over the Earth two billion years ago, and failed because Saturn got in the way. Canâ€™t forget the aliens. His brain still hadnâ€™t figured out a way to process that, so it kept trying to pretend it didnâ€™t exist.</p>
      <p>Holden grabbed a towel and turned on the wall screen in his living room while he dried off. The air was filled with the competing scents of coffee, humidity from the shower, and the faintly grassy and floral scent Tycho pumped into all the residences. Holden tried the news, but it was speculation about the war without any new information. He changed to a competition show with incomprehensible rules and psychotically giddy contestants. He flipped through a few feeds that he could tell were comedies, because the actors paused and nodded where they expected the laughs to be.</p>
      <p>When his jaw started aching, he realized he was gritting his teeth. He turned off the screen and threw the remote onto his bed in the next room. He wrapped the towel around his waist, then poured a mug of coffee and collapsed onto the couch just in time for his door to chime.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� he yelled at the top of his lungs. No one replied. Good insulation on Tycho. He went to the door, arranging his towel for maximum modesty along the way, and yanked it open.</p>
      <p>It was Miller. He was dressed in a rumpled gray suit heâ€™d probably brought from Ceres, and was fumbling around with that stupid hat.</p>
      <p>â€œHolden, heyâ€”â€� he started, but Holden cut him off.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat the hell do you want?â€� Holden said. â€œAnd are you really standing outside my door with your hat in your hands?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller smiled, then put the hat back on his head. â€œYou know, I always wondered what that meant.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNow you know,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>â€œYou got a minute?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Holden waited a moment, staring up at the lanky detective. He quickly gave up. He probably outweighed Miller by twenty kilos, but it was impossible to be intimidating when the person you were staring down was a foot taller than you.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, come in,â€� he said, then headed for his bedroom. â€œLet me get dressed. Thereâ€™s coffee.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden didnâ€™t wait for a reply; he just closed the bedroom door and sat on the bed. He and Miller hadnâ€™t exchanged more than a dozen words since returning to Tycho. He knew they couldnâ€™t leave it at that, as much as he might like to. He owed Miller at least the conversation where he told him to get lost.</p>
      <p>He put on a pair of warm cotton pants and a pullover, ran one hand through his damp hair, and went back out to the living room. Miller was sitting on his couch holding a steaming mug.</p>
      <p>â€œGood coffee,â€� the detective said.</p>
      <p>â€œSo, letâ€™s hear it,â€� Hol>â€œS {,â€den replied, sitting in a chair across from him.</p>
      <p>Miller took a sip of his coffee and said, â€œWellâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI mean, this is the conversation where you tell me how you were right to shoot an unarmed man in the face, and how Iâ€™m just too naive to see it. Right?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œActuallyâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI fucking told you,â€� Holden said, surprised to feel the heat rise in his cheeks. â€œNo more of that judge, jury, and executioner shit or you could find your own ride, and you did it anyway.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes.â€�</p>
      <p>The simple affirmative took Holden off guard.</p>
      <p>â€œWhy?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller took another sip of his coffee, then set the mug down. He reached up and took off his hat, tossed it onto the couch next to him, then leaned back.</p>
      <p>â€œHe was going to get away with it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œExcuse me?â€� Holden replied. â€œDid you miss the part where he confessed to everything?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat wasnâ€™t a confession. That was a boast. He was untouchable, and he knew it. Too much money. Too much power.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s bullshit. No one gets to kill a million and a half people and get away with it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œPeople get away with things all time. Guilty as hell, but something gets in the way. Evidence. Politics. I had a partner for a while, name of Muss. When Earth pulled out of Ceresâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œStop,â€� Holden said. â€œI donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t want to hear any more of your stories about how being a cop makes you wiser and deeper and able to face the truth about humanity. As far as I can tell, all it did was break you. Okay?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, okay.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDresden and his Protogen buddies thought they could choose who lives and who dies. That sound familiar? And donâ€™t tell me itâ€™s different this time, because everyone says that, every time. And itâ€™s not.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWasnâ€™t revenge,â€� Miller said, a little too hotly.</p>
      <p>â€œOh really? This wasnâ€™t about the girl in the hotel? Julie Mao?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCatching him was. Killing himâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>Miller sighed and nodded to himself, then got up and opened the door. He stopped in the doorway and turned around, real pain on his face.</p>
      <p>â€œHe was talking us into it,â€� Miller said. â€œAll that about getting the stars and protecting ourselves from whatever shot that thing at Earth? I was starting to think maybe he should get away with it. Maybe things were just too big for right and wrong. Iâ€™m not saying he convinced me. But he made me think maybe, you know? Just maybe.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd for that, you shot him.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI did.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden sighed, then leaned against the wall next to the open door, his arms crossed.</p>
      <p>â€œAmos calls you righteous,â€� Miller said. â€œYou know that?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAmos thinks heâ€™s a bad guy because heâ€™s done some things heâ€™s ashamed of,â€� Holden said. â€œHe doesnâ€™t always trust himself, but the fact that he cares tells me he isnâ€™t a bad guy.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeahâ€”â€� Miller started, but Holden cut him off.</p>
      <p>â€œHe looks at his soul, sees the stains, and wants to be clean,â€� he said. â€œBut you? You just shrug.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDresden wasâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThis isnâ€™t about Dresden. Itâ€™s about you,â€� Holden said. â€œI canâ€™t trust you around the people I care about.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden stared at Miller, waiting for him to reply, but the cop just nodded sadly, then put his hat on and walked away down the gently curving corridor. He didnâ€™t turn around.</p>
      <p>Holden went back inside and tried to relax, but he felt jumpy and nervous. He would never have gotten off Eros without Millerâ€™s help. There was no question about it: Tossing him out on his ear felt wrong. Incomplete.</p>
      <p>The truth was Miller made his scalp crawl every time they were in the same room. The cop was like an unpredictable dog that might lick your hand or take a bite out of your leg.</p>
      <p>Holden thought about calling Fred and warning him. He called Naomi instead.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� she answered on the second chime. Holden could hear a barâ€™s frantic, alcohol-fueled merriment in the background.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi,â€� he said, then paused, trying to think of some excuse to have called. When he couldnâ€™t think of one, he said, â€œMiller was just here.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, he cornered Amos and me a while back. What did he want?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know,â€� Holden said with a sigh. â€œSay goodbye, maybe.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat are you doing?â€� Naomi asked. â€œWant to meet up?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes. Yes I do.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Holden didnâ€™t recognize the bar at first, but after ordering a scotch from a professionally friendly waiter, he realized it was the same place heâ€™d watched Naomi sing karaoke to a Belter punk song what seemed like centuries before. She wandered in and plopped down across from him in the booth just as his drink showed up. The waiter gave her a questioning smile.</p>
      <p>â€œGah, no,â€� she said quickly, waving her hands at him. â€œIâ€™ve had plenty tonight. Just some water, thanks.â€�</p>
      <p>As the waiter bustled away, Holden said, â€œHow did your, uhâ€¦ What exactly is Golgo, anyway? And how did it go?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGame they play here,â€� Naomi said, then took a glass of water from their returning waiter and drank half of it in one gulp. â€œLike a cross between darts and soccer. Never seen it before, but I seem to be good at it. We won.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGreat,â€� Holden said. â€œThanks for coming. I know itâ€™s late, but this Miller thing freaked me out a bit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe wants you to absolve him, I think.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBecause Iâ€™m â€˜righteous,â€™ â€� Holden said with a sarcastic laugh.</p>
      <p>â€œYou are,â€� Naomi said with no irony. â€œI mean, itâ€™s a loaded term, but youâ€™re as close to it as anyone Iâ€™ve ever known.â€�</p>
