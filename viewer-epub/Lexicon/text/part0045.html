			<p class="x03-Chapter-Number">[FOUR]</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">The helicopter moved through darkness and Yeats peered through the plexiglass at what lay below. Broken Hill was a small cluster of sulfurous lights, like a ship on an ocean of black glass. Occasionally he caught a tiny spark or glimmer, but those were the only signs that something was happening.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Can’t raise any of them,” said a voice in his ear. He was wearing a headset; the voice belonged to Plath, sitting opposite him. “Eliot, the ground team, no one.” She swapped headsets and began to bark into that one and Yeats returned his attention to the landscape. A circular pinprick of lights came into view, surrounding a depthless black hole, which Yeats recognized as the main quarry. He’d never seen it in person before; it was larger than he’d expected. When he’d first taken an interest, some decades before, following hints of something ancient and significant buried there, he could still make out remnants of the hill that had loaned the town its name. Now that was gone—not just erased but inverted, to become this great pit. He found this notable for the demonstration of force it represented. Civilizations rose and fell; what caused them to be remembered was not their contribution to knowledge or culture, not even the size of their empires, but rather how much force they exerted upon the landscape. This was what survived them. A hundred billion lives had passed without leaving a mark since the Egyptians had raised their pyramids, changing the world not figuratively but literally. Yeats admired that. This hole in Broken Hill was nothing, of course, but it would outlast every person on the planet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” said Plath. “We’ve got buildings on fire now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked. There was indeed a flickering.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have to say, I think we’re operating at a high degree of probability that Woolf has deployed the word.” Plath looked at him as if she expected a reaction here: if not an<em class="calibre1"> Oh god no</em> then at least an <em class="calibre1">Are you sure</em>; some kind of response to validate her feeling that this was a shocking development, possibly the worst thing she could imagine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Horrible,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I mean, we’re seeing bodies in the streets. Around the hospital, especially.” She gazed out hopefully. “Maybe it’ll burn down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He considered this. It was rather important that the bareword not be lost to fire. That would be a serious inconvenience. But he was also interested in letting this scenario play out to its fullest, in order to gain maximum information from it. “Please don’t let the hospital burn down.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll monitor it. You know, we could send people in now. Stop this before it gets worse.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s just . . . there are three thousand people down there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If Eliot couldn’t stop it, it can’t be stopped.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath nodded, unconvinced.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It is a great tragedy,” he said. He overlooked this sometimes: the need to display empathy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They circled the town. He watched toy vehicles run down tiny figures, plow into matchbox buildings. Sometimes there was a lull and the little shapes would head for the hospital, and it would begin again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think we’ve found Eliot,” Plath said. She muttered into her other headset for a few moments. “On a road a couple miles out of town. He’s not moving. What do you want to do?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Take me there, please,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can send a team.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath had been doing this lately: implying that Yeats might not know what he wanted. It concerned him a little, because it meant she didn’t think he was acting rationally, and he needed her to think him rational for at least a while longer. “Thank you, but no.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The chopper tilted. He watched a dozen small tragedies play out below before they were obscured by the towering wall of soil and rock that marked the quarry’s boundary. Dust blew around them. Plath unstrapped and pulled open the door. He hesitated, because he was wearing his Ferragamos, winged patent leather that would never be the same after contact with this land. But he had no other shoes. He stepped out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath pointed, mouthing words he couldn’t hear over the thundering of the blades, clawing at her hair. He began to walk, placing his feet carefully on the treacherous sandy earth. He was tempted to abandon the whole idea now. He was upset with himself for forgetting about his shoes. But he was committed: He couldn’t change his mind now without risking revealing something about himself.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Plath caught up with him. She was wearing a perfectly charming pair of Louboutins but clomping along as if they were galoshes. Plath didn’t mind ruining shoes, apparently. He hadn’t known that about her. It changed a great deal.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They reached the road. The chopper had risen into the air and its spotlight helpfully swung right, so he began to trudge in that direction. Plath fiddled with an earpiece. “Still no sign of Woolf,” she said. “I assume she’s still kill-on-sight?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, yes,” he said. “And I expect this to be quite a lot easier to accomplish, now she no longer has the word.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">If</em> she no longer has it. She could be in the hospital still, for all we know.” Plath bent to one knee. Yeats kept walking. When Plath caught him again, her strappy heels dangled from one hand. “I should not have worn these shoes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I bet she’s in there,” Plath said. “Compromising people as they come in.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Please don’t assume that,” he said, because that was all he needed, Woolf slipping away while everyone watched the hospital. He was quite certain Emily was nowhere near, because he had instructed her not to be. She had deployed the word and left, so that once this was all over, he could recover it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is that . . . ?” Plath said, trailing off as the spotlight shifted and made speculation unnecessary. Across the road lay a car; before that was Eliot. Yeats couldn’t tell whether he was alive or dead. “Jesus, she’s killed him. Woolf killed Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He approached to within a few feet. Eliot’s coat flapped in the chopper’s downdraft. Yeats studied his face. After a moment, Eliot blinked. “No,” Yeats said. “Compromised, I believe.” He felt his skin crawl. An emotional reaction. Odd. But it was unnerving to behold: Eliot, disabled. Of all the poets, if he were to select the most difficult to compromise in the field, he would choose Eliot. He <em class="calibre1">had</em> chosen Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We need some people down here right away,” Plath told her radio. “Eliot’s catatonic.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the distance, a siren wailed. It felt like a song, like the word calling to him. It was waiting. He need only collect it. He stood very still, studying his own reaction, because there was no mistaking that he wanted it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeats?” said Plath.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His mouth felt dry. A slight tingling in his palms. He had considered many outcomes for this day, but not the possibility that he would be moved.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re going to want to move. We’ve got emergency services inbound from two directions.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A moment,” he said. He closed his eyes. He could perceive the danger now, the crevice that had swallowed those who came before him. And he could see what needed to be done. He opened his eyes and turned to Plath. To his surprise, she was in the process of snapping a heel from her shoe.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He wasn’t himself; she saw something on his face. “It broke,” she explained. She tossed the heel into the night. Yeats heard it land. Plath began to wedge her feet back into her butchered Louboutins. “Ridiculous things.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When they were away from here, Yeats decided, and safely back at the hotel, he would visit Plath. He would enter her room and wake her gently and make her fuck her shoes. These Louboutins. It would serve a dual purpose, testing his ability to remain unaroused and teaching Plath proper respect for good footwear.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can’t understand what motivated Woolf to do all this,” Plath said. Men in black jogged out of the darkness and began to heft Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We may never know,” Yeats said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Harry ran down the main street, leaving the hospital, the emergency room, and many, many people who needed medical attention. He had tried to help. He had stayed long enough to bandage the jugular of Maude Clovis, who tried to scratch his eyes out as he worked. He had seen Ian Chu from Surgery cut three more jugulars with a scalpel, moving methodically from one person to the next, his eyes carefully judging each attack. He had seen Jim Fowles, a twenty-year cop, bring in a kid with a bleeding head and draw his revolver and execute that kid right there on the floor.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">That was when Harry decided to leave. What he was doing, stabilizing these people, that wasn’t helping them. That was only delaying. He stood and Fowles turned to him. The only reason Harry had not died then, under Fowles’s calm, unsmiling eyes, was that Chu chose that moment to step behind the cop and delicately draw the scalpel from left to right. Fowles gurgled and Chu plucked the revolver from him with his long surgeon’s fingers and turned it over, testing its weight.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Then he had left. He ran, because all he could think was <em class="calibre1">Emily</em>. There was chaos outside but he ran through it. He found her vomiting over the rail of a traffic bridge. He caught her by the arm and hauled her around. Her face was ashen, her pupils dilated, like a junkie’s; for a moment, he barely recognized her. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I did it. I did it.” She wrapped her arms around her head and moaned.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have to get out of here.” He was trying to think of vehicles. Something off-road. If he could get back to the house, they could take the bikes. “People are going crazy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s the <em class="calibre1">word</em>!” she screamed. She got to her feet and took two steps back toward the hospital, then veered around, clutching her head. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Em,” he said. But he knew what she was talking about. That ridiculous piece of wood, with the black symbol, that she’d waved at him back at the house like it was a magical talisman. Like it could command him to obey her. He’d seen it in the ER with a piece of paper tacked to it that said KILL EVERYONE. At the time, it had not been the strangest thing in the room. “Your word? It <em class="calibre1">works</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can’t stop it,” she said. “He won’t let me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He left her and ran back toward the hospital. He was still a hundred yards away when he saw the two police cruisers parked outside. People clawed and reached, spilling over the cars, filling the air with cries. Harry had intended to go in there and get that piece of wood, hack it into a million pieces, but that was clearly going to be very dangerous. He hesitated at the intersection. A car purred behind him and his brain finally registered this as a danger and he threw himself out of its way. It blew by close enough to tug at his clothes and hit one person, then another, and crashed into one of the police cruisers. Its engine revved. Harry could see the driver tugging at the shifter, trying to get the car into gear. A cop came out of the ER and jogged up to the driver and shot him through the window.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He noticed a figure approaching from the side of the hospital, carrying a cleaver. Harry recognized the someone as an orderly. And the cleaver was not actually a cleaver; it just looked like it. It was a bone saw. “Jack?” Harry said, wondering how, exactly, he was supposed to tell the difference between a person carrying a bone saw for self-defense and one who wanted to saw him open with it, and the orderly broke into a run at him, which answered the question. Harry contemplated running but instead opted for waiting for the orderly to get close enough to punch in the face and disarm. This was an option because the orderly was a thin teenager who played a lot of video games, while Harry was not. He looked at the bone saw. But he couldn’t fathom a use for it, and the orderly started to get up, so Harry punched him in the jaw hard enough to keep him down. Then he did run, because more people were emerging from the hospital’s rear, nurses with whom Harry had frequently shared coffee, and, in one case, a bed, and he did not want to face them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When he returned to the traffic bridge, Emily had vanished. He turned in a circle, cursing. He didn’t know what to do. Ahead, the street looked clear. To the left, a small group wandered in his direction, one limping. To the right, not far, a woman lay motionless in the gutter. In the streetlights, her hair looked yellow. She was the only thing in this landscape he could understand, so he went to her. He knelt and checked her vitals. Beth McCartney, the town librarian. Her hair was sticky with dark fluid. His fingers found a depression in her skull about the size of a tennis ball. He sat back on his haunches and exhaled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The group approached him. He recognized the local math teacher, his two daughters, and a woman who ran a little grocery store. Two teenage boys supported the limper, who was a broad-shouldered guy Harry knew as Derek Knochhouse. Harry had pumped Derek’s stomach twice in the past six months. Both times, he had looked better than this. He could tell without touching him that Derek had a shattered pelvis.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thank Christ,” said the schoolteacher. “Harry, you have to help us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s happening?” said the grocery store owner. She was clutching her necklace, a crucifix. “Oh God, is that Beth?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have to get Derek to the hospital.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Car came out of fucking nowhere,” said one of the teenage males. “Fucking <em class="calibre1">took aim</em>. Then it reversed over him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Hnk</em>,” said Derek.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’ve gotta get him to the hospital, Harry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can’t take him to the hospital,” he said. “It’s not safe.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then where? What should we do?” One of the schoolteacher’s daughters tried to push Derek’s hair out of his eyes. Derek coughed and spat meatily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Find a place you can lay him still and barricade yourself in until this is over.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Until <em class="calibre1">what</em> is over?” said the girl. He could see she was looking for a reason to give in to complete hysteria, and this could be it. “Until <em class="calibre1">what</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He plays footy,” said one of Derek’s friends. Harry didn’t know what possible reason the kid had for volunteering this, then realized he was saying it was a tragedy. Derek played football and now would probably never be the same again. It was the worst thing the kid could imagine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He’s got internal bleeding, I think,” said the math teacher. “What do you think, Harry?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is that <em class="calibre1">Beth</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” Harry said. “She’s dead, and I’m sorry, Derek, but nobody can go near the hospital. They’re killing people.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They began to argue with him. He looked for Emily. He was becoming increasingly nervous about where she was.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Police!” said the girl. She broke from the group and ran down the road, waving her arms, the sleeves of her dress flapping. A cop car was sailing toward them, its lights dark, covered in dents. “Over here! Help!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry called out to her and there was a hard, flat sound and the girl folded up and lay on the road. The cruiser continued toward them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?” said the kid.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Go,” Harry said. “Move. Run.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The girl’s father, the schoolteacher, stared at her with his lips apart. In the streetlight, tiny visible hairs all over his face stood on end. Harry had seen this reaction once before, when a fellow paramedic helped him peel open a wrecked car to find her husband inside. He’d had to wrap her in a space blanket, because she froze. She literally froze. Like she’d fallen into ice. It had been the strangest thing he’d ever seen.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jess?” said the kid. He wasn’t calling. It was a question for the group. The cop car drew closer.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Run</em>,” Harry said, and shoved the schoolteacher. He pulled the other girl, the dark-haired one, by her wrist. There was another flat retort. He was tempted to see who that was, the father or possibly Derek Knochhouse, but it made no difference. The girl screamed and twisted in his grip in a way that meant it could have been either, and then he did turn, and saw the cop with one hand on the steering wheel, the other resting his service revolver on the crook of his arm, his eyes moving between the road and the people he was shooting.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The grocery store woman trilled like a bird and sat heavily. The father was already spread out, arms folded, as if he’d carefully lain down. One of the kids had fled but the other was dragging Derek, the one who’d said <em class="calibre1">he plays footy</em>, and Harry shouted at him to run but of course the kid didn’t. Harry tripped on the curb, which was a handy reminder to keep an eye on where the fuck he was going, losing his grip on the dark-haired girl. She began to walk back toward the cop car, her arms out, in order to accomplish what, Harry didn’t know. He spat a curse and went back for her. Then he saw Emily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She was walking down the center of the road. He couldn’t see her face because the streetlight was behind her. There was an appeal in her posture, which he first thought was directed at him, then realized wasn’t, because she was angling toward the police cruiser.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The dark-haired girl spun in a half circle. Harry ran by her falling body. He leaped onto the hood of the police cruiser, skid across, and hit the tarmac on the other side. He reached Emily and threw her over his shoulder. He heard the whine of the cop’s power window behind him. The closest shelter was a bakery, a squat weatherboard much too far away. He jagged, to put a degree of difficulty into it for the cop.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Put me down,” said Emily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ten feet from the bakery door, something bit his ear. The glass door shattered. He kept going and crashed through it, tripping and sprawling onto the tiled floor, feeling bullets everywhere, losing Emily. The interior was lit by a refrigerated drinks cabinet. “Em.” He crawled toward her in the corpse light. “Emily.” He found her hand and got to his feet and hauled her up.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I want to die.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No,” he said. He dragged her into the back room. His hip clipped a table; a stack of baking trays clattered to the ground. He found the rear door and discovered it was bolted in several different ways, some of which required keys. He released Emily and shook it. “Fuck,” he said. He abandoned the door for a smaller, metallic one, with a horizontal handle like a refrigerator’s. Chill air spilled around his ankles. He pulled Emily inside and closed the door and groped in darkness for a lock. But there wasn’t one, of course. You didn’t put a lock on the inside of a cool room. The door didn’t even open the right way—that is, in a way he could block. He gripped the handle and planted his feet and cursed. Maybe the cop wouldn’t chase them. There were plenty of other targets. He listened, straining for sound. The door was so thick, the cop could be right outside. He relaxed his muscles, for the moment when he’d need them. There was a snuffling. Emily was crying. “Em,” he said. “Be quiet.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Quiet.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She kept crying. “I did something really bad.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know. Shut up.” He thought he heard something outside. But it could be anything. It was incredibly cold. Too cold for a permanent hiding place.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I should have been able to stop it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The handle turned in his hands. He resisted. After a moment, the opposing force vanished. He waited in the dark. Something hit the door, hard and sharp. A bullet. Then two more. He held the handle with one hand and flailed in the dark with the other, trying to push Emily down. A sizzling smell reached him. Light bled through three holes in the door. He hadn’t thought a steel-lined refrigerator door would be bulletproof, but the confirmation was still disappointing. He found Emily’s hair and yanked it. She squawked but then he had her wrapped in one arm while he held the handle with the other, hoping the cop would please not shoot off his hand. For a while there was only their breathing. He heard the cop moving around, doing who knew what.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Does it wear off?” he said. “The word?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jesus fuck.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why are you trying to save me?” He ignored this because it was a stupid question. Something outside went: <em class="calibre1">fwick</em>. “I thought you didn’t love me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Quiet.” He saw a flicker. Only a glimmer through the holes in the door, but it was enough to recognize: The cop was setting the bakery on fire.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I got everything wrong.” In the dark, she cried brokenly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He could see it in his mind: the cop hanging back, leaning against a door frame, gun aimed at the cool room. The second Harry popped open this door, the cop would shoot him. Maybe the fire wouldn’t catch. Maybe the cop would give up and go away. Or maybe not. Because it wasn’t KILL A BUNCH OF PEOPLE, was it? It wasn’t KILL AS MANY AS IS CONVENIENT.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s something in my eye,” Emily said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He could hear crackling. The cool room was growing brighter. “Em, I need to open the door.” She had her head in her hands. “<em class="calibre1">Emily.</em> Listen to me. Wait here until I call for you. Understand? Do not move until I call your name.” Was there anything out there he could use as cover? Something he could throw? Yes. Yes, he would hurl a baking tray at the cop, and it would deflect the bullets, and dazzle him with its reflection of the flames, which of course he would have to run through, and then he would disarm the cop with his superior hand-to-hand combat training. “Are you fucking listening to me?” He resisted the urge to take her by the shoulders and shake her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Please just leave me, Harry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He could feel the heat through the walls. The cop must have moved by now. Retreated to the storefront, at least, maybe right out to the street. The greatest danger now was waiting too long, until there was nowhere to go except into an inferno. He released the handle and pried Emily’s hands from her face. For a moment, he thought he really did see something in her eye, but it was only the dancing reflection of flames. “Em. You are pissing me off. But I will never leave you. Ever. So stop talking. We’re getting out of here.” He wound his fingers into hers. “Ready?” She stared at him. “Sure you are,” he said. He scooped her up. Her arms around his neck were stiff as poles. He took a breath, watching the door, the flames flickering behind it. He kissed her, because fuck it, he was probably about to die. Then he kicked open the door and the fire roared like a living thing and he ran into it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She woke in a bed. No. Wrong. On a stretcher. Something portable. She was in a room full of stretchers and it smelled bad. Burned. Wait. That was her. She was singed. She put her hand to her hair and it felt very wrong.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The room was very bright. Beyond wide windows, sunlight leaped from the chrome of half a dozen muscular vehicles, Humvees and trucks and Jeeps. Beyond those was endless rolling earth. She was encircled by a colorful strip of paper on which were letters and numbers and puppies and dinosaurs and elephants. The walls were lined with posters about Brazil and global warming. Beneath the windows were desks, all pushed together. It was a classroom. She was burned, on a stretcher, in a classroom.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” said a woman. “You’re awake.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Emily didn’t know this woman. Which was odd, because Emily knew everyone in Broken Hill. Also, the woman was wearing fatigues, like a soldier. She came closer and checked Emily’s tubes. Emily had tubes. They ran from the insides of her elbows to plastic bags on a trolley beside the bed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How do you feel?” Before she could stop her, the woman peeled up one of Emily’s eyelids with her thumb. “You’re in Menindee. It’s a little town outside Broken Hill.” A patch on her khakis said: <span class="SCAP1">NEILAND, J</span>. “We’re using the school as a hospital. Are you in pain?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Her hands were wrapped in bandages. Like big mittens. There were three other stretcher beds in the room but none were occupied. She tried to sit up. She remembered fire, smoke. Harry carrying her through it. She had passed out. Then she had been flying, skimming across the earth, and bouncing, being held by Harry on a dirt bike. She had seen kangaroos fleeing flames. “Where’s Harry?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The man who brought you in?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” said Emily. “Yes, yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He’s up the hall. They’re working on him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is he all right?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just relax,” said Neiland.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She almost asked, <em class="calibre1">Are you a dog person or a cat person?</em> Because she really wanted to know if Neiland was telling the truth. “Who else?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Who else what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Made it,” she said. “Out.” She was a little freaked out by the empty stretcher beds.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Neiland didn’t answer. Emily felt ice in her heart, a thin sliver, like a stiletto. She put her face in her mitten-hands. Her eye hurt. “I’ll tell them you’re conscious,” said Neiland. “For now, rest.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Once Neiland had left, Emily climbed off of her stretcher. There were tubes to take care of, which she did with her teeth, because her mitten-hands were useless. She was in a green smock, which flapped at her ankles and admitted a breeze at the back. Beneath this she suspected underpants and bandages. She felt padded. She peered out a glass panel on the classroom door and saw nobody so she opened it. A passing soldier pointed at her and said, “Get back inside,” not slowing, and she said, “Okay,” and closed the door and waited until he was gone. The hallway floor was warm. The adjoining classrooms were empty. Farther down the hall, behind a window almost completely obscured by posters, she saw soldiers wearing face masks around a gurney. On the gurney lay someone wrapped in odd gray packages and bandages. The person’s face wasn’t visible but she could see a forearm, blackened and blistered, and knew it as Harry’s. She covered her mouth.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One of the soldiers in face mask saw her and gestured, and Neiland turned and frowned at her. Emily went to the door and tried to open it with her elbows. Neiland pushed it open. “Back to bed,” Neiland said in a low, no-nonsense voice, almost poet-like, which gave Emily a small start. “Bloody hell, did you remove your drip?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Let me sit with him,” Emily said, but without the baritone or the persuasiveness, and Neiland took her arm and marched her down the hall. “Please,” Emily said. But Neiland did not engage. She took Emily back to her classroom and deposited her on the bed. “I want to sit with him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He’ll be okay,” Neiland said. “Stop worrying.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For some reason this caught Emily unawares and she began to shake. She couldn’t even say thank you.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You love him?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” she said. “Yes, yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He was half-dead when he made it to the perimeter. Hard to believe he kept going. He wanted to save you very much.” Neiland gently forced her to recline. “Rest. If anything changes, I’ll let you know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She let herself be forced. “Okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Everything will be fine,” Neiland said, and sunlight flashed from a car outside the windows. It was a low black sedan, very different from the other vehicles, its windows tinted dark. It pulled alongside a truck and stopped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She sat up. “How long have I been here?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“About four hours.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I need to see Harry.” The sedan’s door opened and a woman in a suit emerged, pushing back her hair. Emily had seen this woman once before, years ago. Her name was Plath. “Are you a dog person or a cat person?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Excuse me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Dogs or cats? Which do you like more?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Dogs.” Neiland rose. “Now sleep.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s your favorite color?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Mauve,” said Neiland, one hand on the door, and there was no time for further questions. Emily had spent a grand total of about five minutes with Neiland, and there were twenty-odd segments to which she could feasibly belong, but Emily had spent time piecing together psychographics from first principles and had a strong feeling about fifty-nine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Vecto brillia masog vat</em>,” she said. “Come back here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Neiland swiveled in mid-step. “Thank you,” Emily said. “Thank you, thank you; take me to Harry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She followed Neiland back to the other classroom and approached the gurney while Neiland invented convenient excuses for why the doctors or medics or whoever these face-masked people were to leave. Neiland had said Harry would be fine, but he was swathed in layers and layers and the only parts she could see were swollen and red. His eyes were beneath soft white circles and she wanted these off. “Wake him up,” she told Neiland. “But please be careful.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She reached for his fingers, which were poking out from gauze, but of course her hands were encased as well. “Harry, can you hear me? We’re going to get out of here.” Neiland finished pushing fluid into Harry’s drip and Emily set her to unwrapping her mitten-hands. They looked worse than she’d expected: Her fingers were cracked and blackened, the crevices between them oozing pink fluid. She took Harry’s hand and it hurt but it felt better, too. “When he’s awake, help me get him to a car. We don’t want anyone to see us. You have to get us out of here and not let anyone stop us, understand?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” said Neiland.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He made a noise. She peeled one of the white circles from his eyes and then the other. His eyes moved beneath the lids. “Harry, wake up.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The door opened. She turned. In the doorway stood a soldier she hadn’t seen before, a young guy with a buzz cut. His eyes were focused and intent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, shit,” she said. “<em class="calibre1">Vecto brillia masog vat</em>, don’t let the guy near us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The soldier ran at them and Neiland moved to intercept. They exchanged flat, wordless blows and fell to the floor and Neiland got him in a headlock and began to wind surgical tubing around his throat. Emily was surprised and impressed by Neiland’s badassery. She returned her attention to Harry. He was swimming somewhere beneath consciousness like he was under glass. “Harry, please wake up. You have to wake up. I can’t get you out of here by myself.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Neiland and the soldier crashed into a trolley, scattering surgical equipment. The soldier got free of Neiland and his eyes fell on Emily. She abruptly saw that this wasn’t going to work, her whole escape plan; this guy was going to knock out Neiland and throttle her and Harry, or not even that—the noise alone would bring more people than she could handle, people and soldiers and Plath. She felt panic. “Kill him!” she said, because maybe Neiland wasn’t going full throttle. It seemed to make a difference, because Neiland picked herself up and punched the soldier in the throat in a way that dropped him immediately. “Kill everyone who tries to stop us,” Emily said, and something in her mind leaped, and she realized what she’d said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She felt undone. She felt the realization sinking into her: that she had finally done it, found a way to screw up so badly there was no way back. She had gotten a star in her eye. There were who knew how many people dead in Broken Hill and Yeats had put instructions in her head and she had carried them out. She couldn’t believe, in her core, that she wasn’t responsible. She had killed people and now there was a star in her eye that wanted her to kill more.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry,” she told Harry. She began to cry, partly for herself and partly for Harry, who had tried so hard. Neiland and the soldier grunted and gasped. Emily leaned over and kissed Harry on each eye. “I love you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyes moved rapidly, as if in REM sleep. She hesitated. “Harry,” she said. She saw a response, a tiny neuroelectrical spark. It reminded her of DC, when she had sought out examples of psychographic segments and tested word fragments on them. Back then she had reverse-engineered entire words.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Harry was immune. But maybe he was only immune to the words she knew about. Maybe he was nothing more than a slightly different kind of machine, a psychographic segment of one, which the organization hadn’t targeted only because they didn’t know about it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Ko</em>,” she said. She watched his eyelids. “<em class="calibre1">Ka. Toh.</em>” She knew him very well. She understood which movements were his. “<em class="calibre1">Kik.</em>” A muscle above his lip jumped. She almost gasped. Her mind moved with possibilities, sifting conjugations. “<em class="calibre1">Kik</em>,” she said again, to be sure.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The soldier gargled. She glanced down and saw that his face was purple. Neiland was choking the life from him. She returned her attention to Harry, ignoring everything except the forty-eight muscles around his eyes. She fed him sounds. She built her way to an attention word and that was a good start but not enough. She didn’t know how much time was passing. She focused on the words.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">None of this was going to save her. She knew that. It was too late for her, and had been from the moment the door to the paramedic van had bounced open and reflected the bareword. But it was not too late for Harry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When she was done, she touched his face. “Harry,” she whispered. “<em class="calibre1">Kikkhf fkattkx hfkixu zttkcu.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He changed. She had seen people fall under compromise a hundred times but never him and a part of her died to see it, his face slack, his mind open and waiting for instruction, his soul reduced to machinery. She could say <em class="calibre1">run away with me</em> and <em class="calibre1">do everything I ever tell you</em> and <em class="calibre1">love me forever</em> and he would. She would be loved by the thing she had made him into.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Forget all of this,” she told him. “Get away from here, forget me, forget you ever lived in Broken Hill. Become someone else. <em class="calibre1">Kikkhf fkattkx hfkixu zttkcu</em>, forget me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She stumbled away from the gurney. She couldn’t bear to look at him. Neiland was standing there like a statue, which surprised her. The buzz-cut soldier was on the floor, not moving.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Neiland,” Emily said. “Thank you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Neiland waited.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Take him away,” she said. “Keep him safe.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Once Neiland had put Harry into a Jeep and Emily had watched it speed away into the dust, she returned to the classroom in which she’d awoken and searched around for a marker. Classrooms always had markers. She found a drawer full of colorful ones and took a fistful and went looking for a bathroom. There were many people running around and shouting, but they were mostly outside, drawn by Neiland’s departure. She did not see Plath and was concerned about that, because the worst thing that could happen right now was Plath finding her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She found a girls’ restroom with a long counter and low sinks, for children. She gripped a blue marker in her fist, like a toddler, and began to scrawl on the mirror. The first word was <em class="calibre1">vartix</em>. This had left her slack-jawed in her dormitory room once, but she had been a good student and done her exercises and was not seventeen anymore, so she managed to get through it, pausing between letters to blink at the ceiling and clear her mind. She completed <em class="calibre1">vartix</em> and kept her eyes averted from it while she wrote the second word, and the third, and fourth, and then she had to gag into the sink for a while. But she had done it. She picked up the marker again, and, keeping her head down, added: DIE.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She closed her eyes. She took two steps backward. She breathed. It would only work if she lowered her defenses. <em class="calibre1">I am cared for</em>, she told herself. <em class="calibre1">I am safe.</em> She felt her muscles loosen. She swallowed. <em class="calibre1">Open your eyes. Open your eyes.</em> She began to do it and squeezed them shut again. <em class="calibre1">Do it</em>, she said. <em class="calibre1">Do it, you bitch—you know if they find you they’ll make you tell them about Harry! Do it! You deserve it!</em> Then she began to cry.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She groped toward the counter and found the marker. She kept her eyes away from the command words and located DIE and added a D. Before that, she wrote HARRY. Before she could change her mind, she walked away and then she looked back.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">She was sitting on tiles. Bathroom tiles. Her mind felt bruised. She had the feeling that someone had just compromised her.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Menindee. Of course. Harry had brought her here. He had dragged her out of Broken Hill and saved her life. But then—</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, no,” she said. Harry had died. They hadn’t been able to save him. She had seen him die on the gurney. A wail burst out of her and she forced it down because Plath was out there. The whole organization was probably looking for her. She closed her fist around her grief and made it anger. There would be time for grief later. The point here was that Harry had wanted her to live. She had to survive. She would flee, and hide, and live, because she was good at that. Then she would find a way to return to Yeats and make her vengeance terrible.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">But first. She got to her feet and tried to think how the hell she was going to get out of here.</p>
