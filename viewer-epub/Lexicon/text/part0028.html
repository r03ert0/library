			<p class="x03-Chapter-Number">[THREE]</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">The waitress brought food and coffee and instructed them to enjoy. Wil watched Eliot spread a napkin across his lap, pick up his cutlery, and begin to dissect his eggs. He popped bacon into his mouth and chewed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Go on,” Eliot said through bacon. “Eat.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil picked up his knife and began to push food around. It was beyond him how Eliot could shoot people dead and fly all night and then tuck into a hearty breakfast. It was wrong. Because Eliot had known those people at the ranch, including a woman he’d shot dead, Charlotte Brontë, and you shouldn’t have an appetite after something like that. It suggested that Eliot really was psychopathic—not the crazy, <em class="calibre1">voices-told-me-to-kill</em> way, but actually, medically psychopathic, in the sense of lacking the ability to feel anything. But even this bothered Wil less than the <em class="calibre1">way</em> Eliot was eating, which was with quick, purposeful movements, his eyes sectioning up the plate for maximum efficiency. This was wrong because Eliot hadn’t slept since Wil had met him. He should be exhausted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This is even better than I expected,” Eliot said. He pointed at Wil’s plate with his knife. “You need to eat.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil ate without enthusiasm. His bacon tasted like nothing. Like a dead animal, fried. His eggs, aborted chickens.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ll say this for the Midwest,” Eliot said. “They know how to do a breakfast.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil poked a bacon strip with his fork. In its <a id="Anchor-3"></a>rufescent flesh he saw the man he’d shot on the overturned pickup. The way he’d folded up. He put down his cutlery.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you all right?” No concern in Eliot’s voice, of course. It was just a question. An inquiry after facts. Wil rose and tottered to the rear of the diner. He found a single, dirty toilet, lowered himself to his knees, and vomited. When he was done, he sat back against the wall, eyes closed, sweat popping all over his body. He decided to stay here awhile. You were safe in a bathroom. It was a four-by-six cubicle of sanctuary, for as long as you wanted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When he could no longer believe this, he washed and reentered the diner. A man in a trucker cap with hollow cheeks and serial killer glasses eyed him over hash browns. Wil could read his face clearly: He thought Wil had been doing drugs. The waitress was sneaking looks at him, too. And there was a red-cheeked man wedged into a booth seat, who was watching a burbling TV bolted into the ceiling corner but hadn’t been a moment ago. He felt an urge to explain himself. <em class="calibre1">It’s not what you think. I’ve just had a really rough day.</em> But that would be crazy. He would convince no one.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He shuffled back to the booth. Eliot had finished his own breakfast and switched plates with Wil. “Hey,” he said. “Order more. I’m paying.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, no,” said Eliot. “But you know what I mean.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil sat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You could use the protein,” said Eliot, chewing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s your plan?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hmm?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“These people, they’re going to find us again, aren’t they? They’re looking for us right now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No doubt.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So we need a plan.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot nodded. “True.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you have one?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You don’t?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have a short-term plan,” Eliot said. “I plan to finish your eggs.” Wil said nothing. “Food is important. I’m serious about the protein.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you have a plan or not?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shouldn’t you, I don’t know, be concerned about that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I am concerned about that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You don’t look concerned.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Would it make you feel better if I were sweating? Running to the bathroom to blow my cookies? It shouldn’t. A panic state is not helpful to good decision making.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It would make me feel better if we were <em class="calibre1">moving</em>,” Wil said. “Like if you got your eggs to <em class="calibre1">go</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, I like to know where I’m going before I try to get there. It’s a mistake to try to execute a plan before you’ve thought of one, in my experience.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil exhaled. “Can you call them?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Pardon me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Get a poet on the phone. You used to be one of them. Call them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And say what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know. Persuade them to stop chasing us. That’s what you do, isn’t it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. But it’s also what they do.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then offer them something. Make a deal. Give them something they want.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But what they want is you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Something else.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot retired his cutlery. “You’re the key to an object of biblical power. They’re not interested in substitutes.” He stretched his arms. “And when I say biblical, I mean literally from the Bible.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He rubbed his face. Every time Eliot spoke, Wil felt that he knew less.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Keep talking, though,” Eliot said. “I feel like it’s helping, in a process of elimination kind of way.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We should hide, then. Go somewhere, you do your poet thing, make people hide us. That’s possible, right?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Before yesterday, I would have said yes. We thought we were hiding. In light of recent events, though, it seems what we were actually doing was being observed until we led Woolf to you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So we can’t hide.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We can try. But to date it hasn’t been very successful.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The waitress arrived to refill Eliot’s coffee. She was young and pink cheeked. Her name tag said <span class="SCAP1">SARAH</span>. She seemed to be in awe of Eliot, although Wil didn’t know why. “Thank you, Sarah,” said Eliot, and she flushed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So we <em class="calibre1">can’t</em> hide,” Wil said, once she’d left, “and we can’t negotiate, and we can’t stay here, and you don’t want to leave until we know where we’re going, is that about right?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” Eliot agreed. “That’s about right.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then what are we going to do?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I believe our only option is confrontation. Specifically, the kind of confrontation that leaves them dead and us alive.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” he said. “This sounds like a plan.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s not. It’s a goal.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jesus!” Wil said. “Talking to you is like herding cats.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot raised his coffee and blew at it. “The problem is that Woolf and I are evenly matched, but she is excellently resourced and supported by skilled poets, while I have nothing and no one but you, and you’re useless. That’s not a personal commentary. It’s a statement of fact. So I’m finding it hard to imagine any scenario wherein we confront Woolf and survive. It also means our enemies will continue to pursue us rapidly and relentlessly, since we represent little danger. It’s more or less the same problem that those of us who left the organization have faced for some time. Our enemies have a bareword and we don’t.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They have a what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The word that killed Broken Hill,” Eliot said. “They have that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And it’s a bareword.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Which is what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Useful.” He gazed at Wil. “Hence our attempt to lift it from your brain. Still a good plan, if it’s in there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You wanted it to <em class="calibre1">use</em>? I thought you wanted my immunity. You said you wanted to <em class="calibre1">stop</em> it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Mmm,” said Eliot. “Some untruths were told, in the interests of acquiring your compliance. I was actually somewhat concerned at the time that you might use the word against me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But I don’t remember it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If I did . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, things would be different.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Woolf wouldn’t be chasing us?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“She would,” Eliot said, “but more cautiously.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked out the window, at snow and clouds like granite. He could not imagine living in dirt and desert. “I really don’t remember anything about Broken Hill.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” Eliot said. He drained his coffee. “That’s a shame.” The waitress, Sarah, descended on them, refilling his cup. “Aren’t you a peach,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you from the East Coast?” She reddened. “It’s just, your accent.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re right!” Eliot said. “Well, I am. He’s from Australia.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Really</em>,” Sarah said, looking at Wil in a new way. “I’d love to travel, one day.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, you should,” Eliot said. “The world is closer than you think.” Wil looked out the window again. He felt tempted to rise, toss his napkin on the table, and walk out. Just walk on down the road, snow falling in his hair, until something happened. One way or the other. At least it would be doing something. Something stupid, most likely. But something. “Now that necklace is truly beautiful,” Eliot said. “Did you make it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s my grandmother,” said the waitress. A carved piece of wood, a woman in profile. A <em class="calibre1">relief</em>, was that what you called it? The woman looked stern. “I carved it from a photo.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think you’re very talented,” Eliot said. “Sarah, I apologize, but would you give me a few minutes? I’ve just thought of something I need to discuss with my colleague.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, sure. No problem.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She left. Wil looked at Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck me,” Eliot said. “The fucking necklace.” Wil waited. From now on when Eliot said something he didn’t understand, he was going to wait. “We’re going to Broken Hill.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We thought she got it out. But she didn’t. She made a copy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil waited.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck!” Eliot said. “We need to move.” He rose.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">The chopper sat above the road, billowing snow, making the power lines dance. Below them sat a small plane. It had been abandoned; she could see the steps hanging out of its side. The pilot’s voice crackled through her headphones. He was sitting right next to her, but sounded like he was dialing in from Mars. “You want to set down?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She shook her head. The pilot pulled back on the stick. The world below dropped away. They flew over snowfields that were like a million brilliant daggers, and she turned away, because it hurt the star in her eye. She had a little supernova searing her retina. That was how it felt. It never really went away but was always worse in the light. Anyplace she could see the sun. Sometimes she thought she could see it: a little white hole in the world.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Two minutes,” said the pilot. “We have a diner. Center of town. We’ve encircled but haven’t approached. How do you want to do this?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Safely,” she said. “Have them sweep it, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The pilot nodded. She heard him passing on the instruction: <em class="calibre1">Sweep it; we’re staying airborne.</em> The town emerged as a smudge in the snowscape. It had one road in and one road out, perhaps a dozen buildings. As they hovered, she watched black cars rocket up from each direction and disgorge tiny figures. They moved from building to building, gesturing and sometimes stopping to consult each other. The chances of them finding Eliot and the outlier here were a thousand to one. But she had to be careful. The thing to remember was that all the power in the world didn’t stop a bullet. She had been taught chess at the school, years ago, and the point was the pieces differed only in terms of their attacking power. They were all equally easy to kill. Capture. It was called capturing. The lesson was that you should be cautious about deploying your most powerful pieces, because it only required one dumb pawn to take them down.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The pilot got the signal and began to settle the chopper toward the street. She watched the town tilt toward her through the bubble windshield. <em class="calibre1">Now’s your chance, Eliot. I’m just sitting here.</em> Eliot was a bishop, she figured, prone to sneaky long-range attacks, and more mobile than you expected. She had never liked bishops.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re green,” said the pilot. She unbuckled. A young man with long hair, Rosenberg, opened the door and offered her his hand, which she found kind of insulting and ignored. The chopper’s blades pulled at her hair. She studied the street, trying to sense trace elements of Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Diner’s clear,” said Rosenberg. “I’m guessing they acquired a car here, maybe a couple hours ago. Three proles inside, segmented and compromised, instructed to obey. We haven’t questioned them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Thank you,” she said. “I’ll take it from here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She made for the low diner. A few poets moved toward her and Rosenberg waved them away. Inside, behind the counter, was a young, scared waitress in a green apron. In a booth was a red-cheeked man she presumed was a farmer. A skinny guy in big glasses was manning a table. The door wheezed closed behind her. The man with glasses rose unsteadily from his table. “I ain’t cooperating with the government. You want to—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sit down, shut up.” He dropped into his seat. She pointed to the waitress. “You come here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The waitress jerked forward, clutching a notepad. Her eyes were huge.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Two men. One dark, one white. You know who I’m talking about?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The waitress’s head bobbed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Tell me everything you saw and heard.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The waitress began to talk. A minute later, the farmer began to fish a cell phone from his jeans pocket. He was trying to be surreptitious, but his wide checked shirt telegraphed every twitch. She found it fascinating: Did he think she was blind? She let him go awhile, until he got the phone out and opened its lid as carefully as if it contained an engagement ring. Then she said, “Put your hand in your mouth.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And I poured him another refill,” said the waitress. “He was real nice and we got to talking and I asked if he was from L.A. or New York or somewhere like that, and he said yes, he’d been all over, he’d seen fireworks in London and riots in Berlin, and I should go, he said. He said the world was closer than I imagined. Those were his words.” The farmer began to gag. “And then he wanted to talk to his friend, the Australian, and after he asked if he could borrow a car. I said sure, and gave him the keys to my car, and I felt bad, because I hadn’t cleaned it for like a year and I wished I had something nicer. I thought—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t care what you thought.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I asked where he might be going and he said where did I recommend, and I said anywhere but here, and he smiled at that. Then we talked about places I had been, and I said when I was a girl my mom once took me to El Paso, just the two of us, and—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right,” she said. “Stop.” She pondered. The farmer made a sound like <em class="calibre1">gwargghh</em> and threw up around his hand. He had wedged the whole thing in there. She wouldn’t have thought that was possible. She watched him twitch and gag. She should tell him to take that out. There was no benefit in a dead farmer. “Did you hear any talk of towns? States? Airports?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You have no idea where he’s going?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Wherever he wants,” said the waitress. “A man like that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah,” she said. “Okay.” Outside, her people would have gleaned which direction Eliot had gone, east or west. With the registration information, they would locate the car within a few hours. It would be abandoned, of course, at a gas station or on a side street, but that would be the start of a new trail. The fact was Eliot could not keep moving forever. He could not move faster than the net she could draw around him. <em class="calibre1">Nothing personal, Eliot</em>, she thought. She wanted to shoot him. As in, do it personally. She felt quite strongly about that. Also, before she did it, she wanted a few minutes to talk things over. That was probably a pipe dream. It was hard to imagine circumstances in which she would be able to capture Eliot without killing him. But if she did, she would like to tell him that she appreciated the guidance he had given her, in the beginning. She wanted to say, <em class="calibre1">I wouldn’t be who I am without you, Eliot</em>, and have him see she meant it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The farmer jerked. His head hit the table. Vomit dripped to the floor. “Take . . .” she said, but it was too late. She had meant to tell him to take out his hand. But she had forgotten. Or something like that. <em class="calibre1">Hey, Emily, you know what stars do? They eat. They burn everything around until there’s nothing left. Then they start eating light. You realize that’s what you’re doing, right? Eating everything?</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She looked at the waitress. The sensible thing to do here was to kill her. The girl had exchanged words with Eliot; she was potentially loaded with instructions. The possibility was small but there was no sense in taking chances.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><em class="calibre1">It’s not getting any better, is it? I mean, that’s been obvious for a while now, right? That the star isn’t going anywhere?</em></p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Forget we were here,” she told the waitress. “That guy choked on his breakfast and you couldn’t save him.” She turned to leave. “But you tried as hard as you could.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">They drove until dark, stopping only to eat and persuade people to trade vehicles. Wil didn’t want to watch but couldn’t help it. At first, the person who Eliot approached would look guarded. Then Eliot would say something and their face would break into a smile. Like they didn’t want to but couldn’t help it. It was fascinating how much they changed in that moment. From stranger-person to friend-person. They showed a completely different face. And then a minute later their expression would change again, becoming intimate and unarranged, and Wil would turn away, because watching that felt wrong.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Embedded in a pink Mini, a bobbling plastic cat on the dashboard, he said, “So you have a plan now?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” Eliot jiggled the gearshift. He was not happy with fifth. Wil had offered to drive, but Eliot had refused. He was beginning to think Eliot didn’t sleep at all.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do I get to hear it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We go to Broken Hill, get the bareword, and use it to defeat our enemies.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s just sitting there? In Broken Hill?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s my theory.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re not sure?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What, no one thought to check? You didn’t swing by, see if there’s this, what, Bible-grade weapon lying around?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It wasn’t quite as simple as swinging by. After Woolf, anyone who <em class="calibre1">swung by</em> didn’t swing out again.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“But we’re going in.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” Eliot glanced at him. “You’ll be fine.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When you say <em class="calibre1">we</em> are going in . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I mean you. Since I’m not immune.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He watched them pass a family sedan. A happy dog looked at him and he felt jealous. “What if you’re wrong and <em class="calibre1">I’m</em> not immune?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, that would be bad. But let’s not get hung up on every little thing that might go wrong. I’m not saying the plan is foolproof. I’m saying it’s preferable to driving aimlessly until our luck runs out.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Then what happens? I give you the word?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. You must not speak it around me, show it to me, or describe it even in general terms. I can’t emphasize this enough.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you serious?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Look at me,” Eliot said. “If you get this thing and drop so much as a hint about what it looks like, I will feed you your own fingers. Do you believe me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” They passed through a town advertising a beet festival from three years ago. “I still don’t understand how it’s a word. Words can’t kill people.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sure they can. Words kill people all the time.” He wrestled the gearshift. “Granted, this one is more direct about it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What makes this one special?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, that’s difficult to explain without referencing some fairly advanced linguistics and neurochemistry.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Give me an analogy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s a tree in a park. A tree you want cut down, for some reason. You phone the city and ask which department you need to contact and which forms you need to fill out. Your application goes to a committee, which decides whether it makes a good case, and if so, they send out a guy to cut down the tree. That’s the brain’s regular decision-making process. What I do, which you call ‘word voodoo,’ is I bribe the committee. It’s the same process. But I’m neutralizing the parts that can say no. With me so far?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“All right. What’s in Broken Hill is a bareword. A bareword, in this analogy, is me getting out my chainsaw and cutting down the tree.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil waited.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s a separate pathway to the same outcome. I don’t use the committee. I skip it. Does that make sense?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It does for trees.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s no different. Your brain has multiple pathways to action. You see a hot stove, you consciously decide to stay clear of it. But if you stumble onto it, you’ll jerk back without conscious thought.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So it’s the difference between a voluntary action and a reflex,” Wil said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why didn’t you just say that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Because that’s not an analogy. That’s exactly what fucking happens. You asked for an analogy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” he said. “Although I still don’t understand how a reflex can be triggered by a <em class="calibre1">word</em>.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Words aren’t just sounds or shapes. They’re meaning. That’s what language is: a protocol for transferring meaning. When you learn English, you train your brain to react in a particular way to particular sounds. As it turns out, the protocol can be hacked.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Can you teach me?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What you do. The word voodoo.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why not?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Because it’s complicated.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It doesn’t look complicated.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well,” Eliot said, “it is.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t see why you couldn’t teach me a little.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We don’t have time to train you into a competent poet. If we did, it still wouldn’t work, because you’re not naturally compelling. If you were, I still wouldn’t, because you have very little discipline, and we’ve learned recently that giving immensely powerful words to people with self-control issues is a very bad idea.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not naturally compelling?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot glanced at him. “Not really, no.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m compelling.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re the only known outlier to a bareword,” said Eliot. “Hang your hat on that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He was silent. “What makes me immune?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Your brain doesn’t process language quite like other people. Why that is, I have no idea.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I have a superior brain?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Uh,” Eliot said, “I wouldn’t go that far.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can resist persuasion; sounds like an improvement to me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I once had a coffee machine that wouldn’t add milk no matter how I pressed the buttons. It wasn’t better. It was just broken.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not broken. Who are you to say I’m broken?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot said nothing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s evolution,” Wil said. “You guys have been preying on us for who knows how long and I evolved a defense.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What was your girlfriend’s name?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Cecilia, right?” Eliot glanced at the dash. “Twenty-four hours, you haven’t mentioned her.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What are you saying? I should be grieving?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot nodded. “That’s what I’m saying.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Who the fuck are . . . I’ve been trying to stay alive! People have been driving <em class="calibre1">cattle trucks</em> at my body! Forgive me for not taking a minute to cry on your shoulder about my girlfriend!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Solid reasons, delivered with much defensiveness.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You asshole! Jesus! As if you know anything about love! What do <em class="calibre1">you</em> think it is? Brain activity? Neurochemicals?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I suspect it’s a kind of persuasion.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So I’m immune to it? That’s your theory?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The most fundamental thing about a person is desire. It defines them. Tell me what a person wants, truly wants, and I’ll tell you who they are, and how to persuade them. You can’t be persuaded. Ergo, you don’t feel desire.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s bullshit! I loved Cecilia!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If you say so.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m being lectured about love by a <em class="calibre1">robot</em>! I’m broken? <em class="calibre1">You’re</em> broken! Tell me what you think love is! I seriously want to know!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” Eliot said. “It’s defining yourself through the eyes of another. It’s coming to know a human being on a level so intimate that you lose any meaningful distinction between you, and you carry the knowledge that you are insufficient without her every day for twenty years, until she drives an animal transport at you, and you shoot her. It’s that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil watched the road awhile.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry I called you broken,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Forget it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Everyone’s broken,” Eliot said, “one way or another.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He slept and woke to the windshield filled with a great metal lattice. A bridge, he realized, its steel beams splashed by yellow sodium-vapor streetlights. Eliot had one arm slung over the seat and was reversing around oncoming traffic. A car swung by them, horn blaring. A motorcycle stuttered past, the driver yelling unintelligibly. They swung around a corner and Eliot turned off the Mini’s engine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Traffic camera on the bridge,” said Eliot. “Almost drove through it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked out at a coffee shop advertising waffles. The street was lined with tall, quaint buildings, most in pastel colors under a dusting of snow. The streetlights were trimmed with iron lacework. No people in sight. It felt late. “Where are we?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Grand Forks.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What are we doing?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re waiting,” Eliot said. “Once a little time has passed, we’re going to walk across that bridge. One at a time, I think, since I may have aroused suspicion just now. On the other side, we’re going to acquire a vehicle and continue to Minneapolis. There we’ll take passport photos in subpar lighting conditions and visit the Federal Building on Third Avenue South, which is a designated passport agency, and can issue replacement passports to people who have had theirs stolen, which we will claim has occurred. We will be asked to provide documentation proving, firstly, that we’re U.S. citizens, and, secondly, that we are the people named in the first documents. This will occur in a genial, low-pressure interview, as opposed to at the front of an airport queue with an official holding out one hand for our papers, so should allow me to compromise our interviewer into accepting our mall booth passport photos. This person will then begin the process of issuing new passports in false names with our photos on them.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Doesn’t that take weeks?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. It takes four hours, if you pay the expedition fee. We will then take a roundabout route to Sydney, balancing the need to arrive before our false documentation is discovered against the need to avoid airports with face-recognition technology. I’m thinking Vancouver and then Seoul, since Korean Air is a good airline for our purposes. No data sharing. Does that answer your question?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” They waited. Wil yawned. A woman walked by who reminded Wil of someone but he didn’t know who.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot opened the door. “Wait ten minutes then walk directly across the bridge. Keep your head down. That’s important. No looking up for any reason. Clear?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Clear,” he said. Eliot climbed out. The door went <em class="calibre1">clunk</em>. He watched Eliot’s beige coat disappear around the coffee shop.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The windows fogged. The car filled with cold. He thought about Cecilia. He’d met her in a pet store. He’d walked past and doubled back and pretended to be interested in puppies. Almost bought one, even. Just because she was selling them. On their second date, he discovered she didn’t like animals much. She only liked organizing them. Deciding what they ate. She liked putting them in cages, basically. When Cecilia had started dropping marriage hints, about three months in, Wil had thought of that.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He got out of the car. It was misty, visibility down to a few hundred feet. He stuck his hands in his pockets and started walking. Eyes down. The occasional car plumed by to his left, plowing slush. He reached the bridge and began to cross. A black river slid by below. It was a high bridge. Long, too. He hadn’t realized how long. A pickup truck made an odd note and he looked up before remembering he was not supposed to do that. About halfway across a vehicle approached from behind and slowed. He kept walking. The car’s tires crunched snow. It was keeping pace with him. He didn’t turn. He could see the far side now but no Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The world splashed red and blue. Static barked. “Sir, stop where you are.” This was a megaphone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He stopped. A police cruiser rolled up to him. The door opened and a cop with a dark mustache climbed out. “Mind taking your hands out of your pockets, sir?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He showed his hands.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Sir, are you the owner of a pink Mini, registration jay cee ex one four zero?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You don’t know that vehicle?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, officer.” The wind blew. He looked at the end of the bridge but still no Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where are you headed tonight, sir?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m just crossing the bridge.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I can see that. Where are you headed?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He checked for Eliot again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Am I keeping you from something?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, officer. I’m just cold.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Put your hands on the hood, sir.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Um,” said Wil.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Put your hands on the hood.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He placed his hands on the car.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Legs apart, please.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m just out walking.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Legs apart.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He obeyed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m going to pat you down now. Do you understand what that means?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay, I was in the Mini. If there’s a fine—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do not turn around!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I wasn’t turning around,” he said. The cop grabbed him by the neck of his jacket and spread him across the hood. It was a slab of ice. He could stick to this car. The cop’s hands probed legs and hips, delving into his pockets. He felt a loosening around his buttocks and realized the cop had taken his wallet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Wil Parke? That’s you?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Look—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stay on the car! You stay there until I tell you otherwise, understand? If you move again, we’re going to have a problem.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His cheek pressed against the hood, he saw a figure approaching through the snow mist. Eliot? He couldn’t tell.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Dispatch, four-one-three,” the cop said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He felt alarm. A cop reporting that he’d picked up Wil Parke, that could be bad. He raised himself from the hood, keeping his hands up so the cop wouldn’t overreact, but a nightstick leaped into his throat anyway and he found himself bending backward over the hood, the cop shouting in his face. “Wait,” Wil said, but the cop wasn’t interested in what he had to say. He caught a glimpse of Eliot’s familiar coat, approaching in brisk strides. The cop’s grip on him slackened. His expression changed. As if the guy were watching TV, Wil thought. Seeing something interesting but far away. The cop unhitched his radio. “Dispatch,” he said, and there were two flat bangs and the cop pinwheeled backward. Eliot walked up to him and fired twice more.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck!” said Wil. His voice was thin and breathless. “What? What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Quiet.” The air was beginning to glow: an approaching car. Eliot walked onto the road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked at the cop. His eyes were glassy. Blood congealed around his body, staining the road salt. “What about the word voodoo?” Eliot didn’t answer. “Why didn’t you <em class="calibre1">persuade</em> him?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A pickup crested the bridge. Eliot waved his arms and the pickup stopped and the driver leaned out the window. A young guy with sandy hair. Eliot was going to kill this guy—him and anyone else in the car, and then whoever passed by. Wil started to run, slipped on the ice, and banged his knee on the blacktop. By the time he reached them, Eliot had his gun pointed at the driver. “Fifty,” the guy said. “I don’t know what you want—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot said, “Do you love your family?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Eliot!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Of course I do, man, please don’t kill me, I have two girls and I love them so much—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I won’t kill you if you tell me this,” said Eliot. He was becoming brighter, almost glowing. Another car approaching, Wil realized. “Why did you do it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot.” He put his hand on Eliot’s arm and tried to steer the gun down. “Please don’t shoot this guy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is this about . . . ?” said the driver. “Oh, Jesus, forgive me, I did it because I had to.” Eliot lowered the gun. The truck driver’s breath came out in a rush. “Thank you, thank you—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Geetyre massilick croton avary</em>,” Eliot said. “Take this. Shoot cars. Run away from cops.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The driver took Eliot’s gun. Eliot opened the pickup’s door and the driver stepped out. He looked up and began to walk toward Wil.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What . . .” Wil said. The guy raised the gun. Wil had time to plug his fingers into his ears. The guy fired, and Wil turned to see a car behind him, a dark wagon. It braked and began to reverse, its beams swinging crazily from side to side. The guy broke into a run, following.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot seized his arm. “Walk.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He walked. “Why?” Wil said. “Why?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shut up,” Eliot said. There was a flatness in his voice. Wil shut up.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">Once they were clear of Grand Forks, the road was empty. After about half an hour, three police cars blew by in the opposite direction, all noise and light, and Wil didn’t say anything and neither did Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He watched the sky begin to lighten. “You’re not a good guy,” Wil said. “You say you are, but you’re not.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t believe I ever said I was a good guy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You could have used your words on that cop.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He was compromised. He was two seconds away from calling us in.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You could have tried.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A sign drifted by, announcing two hundred miles to Minneapolis.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re just as bad as Woolf,” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot braked. Wil’s seat belt grabbed him. The car slid to a steaming halt.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I will take a lot of shit from you,” Eliot said, “but I will not be compared to Woolf.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“She—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shut up. The worst thing I have ever done is allow Woolf to become what she is. I will wear responsibility for everything she does, from Broken Hill until the day I put her in the ground. But we aren’t the same. Not even close.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You kill people.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes, I kill people, when the alternative is worse. That’s the world. That’s the reason you and I are still here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked away. “I’ll come with you. I’ll do what you say. But not because you’re right.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot put the car in gear. “Fine,” he said. “Close enough.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">At the Minneapolis airport no one stopped them or looked twice at their passports and they boarded a Delta E-175, its engines roaring outside the windows. Eliot rolled his coat into a tight bundle and wedged it between the headrest and the wall. “I’m going to sleep.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked at him. “Really?” They were flying to Winnipeg. It was forty minutes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Really,” said Eliot, and closed his eyes. His face relaxed. His lips parted. Wil began to think he wasn’t breathing. When they lifted off, the plane yawed sharply and the woman across the aisle let out a shriek, and Eliot’s head flopped onto Wil’s shoulder. “Eliot?” He put his hand beneath Eliot’s nostrils. He couldn’t feel anything. He licked his skin and tried again. A faint current of air. Very faint. He tried to relax.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They landed roughly but still Eliot didn’t move. Wil dug his elbow into his ribs. “Eliot.” He shook his shoulder. “Tom.” He shook him harder. He put his thumb and forefinger on Eliot’s forearm and pinched.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot’s eyes opened. They were like glass. His face was gray and drawn. He looked dead.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’ve landed.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot’s eyes stared at something beyond the plane’s ceiling.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re here. Eliot. You have to wake up. <em class="calibre1">Eliot.</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He focused. “What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You look terrible.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m fine,” Eliot said, and all of a sudden he was. He pulled the coat from the headrest and tucked it under his arm. “Move.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">In Winnipeg they caught a flight to Vancouver, and again Eliot fell asleep as soon as they were on board, and again rousing him upon landing was like trying to reanimate a corpse. In Vancouver they crossed to the international terminal and passed through security without incident. The Korean Air flight attendants wore blue paper hats. Eliot settled into a window seat with his rolled-up coat and closed his eyes. “Wake me if we enter an unexpectedly steep descent.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Uh,” said Wil. But Eliot seemed to be already asleep. “Yeah. I’ll do that.” He flicked through the in-flight magazine, then put it back. He didn’t think he would be sleeping.</p>
