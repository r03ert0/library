			<p class="Internet-Post">OK, I don’t want to get into conspiracy theories, but you read about this guy who shot up Grand Forks? They said he’d had a fight with his girlfriend, so we all thought, “Oh, that’s why he flipped out.” But notice nobody has actually said there’s a connection. They’ve just let us assume that because why else would they mention it.</p>
			<p class="Internet-Post">I’m not saying there’s something here with this specific incident, but I see this ALL THE TIME. If you watch TV news, every story is like this: “There was a fire and the owner was in financial trouble.” They’re not saying he burned down his own place. But that’s all they’re going to tell you.</p>
			<p class="Internet-Post">That bothers me because we think we’re being clever, putting the pieces together, but it’s a set-up. We’ve only been given pieces that fit together one way, but if it turns out they make the wrong picture, well, they never said it was right.</p>
			<p class="Internet-Post">Unless it’s a really big deal, like a national story, all the reporting comes from one reporter who writes down what the cops say. That goes on AP and the news services all share it. So it can look like they’ve all done their research and found the same facts, but it’s usually just everyone parroting one source.</p>
			<p class="Internet-Post">Now, probably the guy in Grand Forks really did just get pissed off with his girlfriend. But I think it’s worth noting that literally nobody has claimed that’s why he started shooting. If they’d said it was a mystery, then people like us would get curious and ask questions, but apparently all it takes is one unsubstantiated hint and we’re satisfied, because we think we figured it out.</p>
