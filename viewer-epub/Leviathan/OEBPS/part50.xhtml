      <h2>â€œIâ€™d say youâ€™re responsible for at least part of...</h2>
      <p>Fredâ€™s smile reached all the way to his eyes.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd what exactly would that be?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNegotiating terms,â€� Dresden replied. â€œYou are a man of experience. You understand that your victory here puts you in an untenable position. Protogen is one of the most powerful corporations on Earth. The OPA has attacked it, and the longer you try to hold it, the worse the reprisals will be.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIs that so?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOf course it is,â€� Dresden said, waving Fredâ€™s tone away with a dismissing hand. Miller shook his head. The man genuinely didnâ€™t understand what was going on. â€œYouâ€™ve taken your hostages. Well, here we are. We can wait until Earth sends a few dozen battleships and negotiate while you look down the barrels, or we can end this now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re asking meâ€¦ how much money I want to take my people and just leave,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œIf moneyâ€™s what you want,â€� Dresden said with a shrug. â€œ Dres crugWeapons. Ordinance. Medical supplies. Whatever it is you need to prosecute your little war and get this over with quickly.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI know what you did on Eros,â€� Fred said quietly.</p>
      <p>Dresden chuckled. The sound made Millerâ€™s flesh crawl.</p>
      <p>â€œMr. Johnson,â€� Dresden said. â€œNobody knows what we did on Eros. And every minute I have to spend playing games with you is one I canâ€™t use more productively elsewhere. I will swear this: You are in the best bargaining position right now that you will ever have. There is no incentive for you to draw this out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd youâ€™re offering?â€�</p>
      <p>Dresden spread his hands. â€œAnything you like and amnesty besides. As long as it gets you out of here and lets us return to our work. We both win.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred laughed. It was mirthless.</p>
      <p>â€œLet me get this straight,â€� he said. â€œYouâ€™ll give me all the kingdoms of the Earth if I just bow down and do one act of worship for you?â€�</p>
      <p>Dresden cocked his head. â€œI donâ€™t know the reference.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Forty-One: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The Rocinante docked with Thoth station on the last gasps from her maneuvering thrusters. Holden felt the stationâ€™s docking clamps grab the hull with a thud, and then gravity returned at a low one-third g. The close detonation of a plasma warhead had torn off the outer door of the crew airlock and flooded the chamber with superheated gas, effectively welding it shut. That meant theyâ€™d be using the cargo airlock at the stern of the ship and spacewalking over to the station.</p>
      <p>That was fine; they were still in their suits. The Roci had more holes now than the air cycling system could keep up with, and their shipboard O2 supply had been vented into space by the same explosion that killed the airlock.</p>
      <p>Alex dropped from the cockpit, face hidden by his helmet, his belly unmistakable even in his atmosphere suit. Naomi finished locking her station and powering down the ship, then joined Alex, and the three of them climbed down the crew ladder to the shipâ€™s aft. Amos was waiting there, buckling an EVA pack onto his suit and charging it with compressed nitrogen from a storage tank. The mechanic had assured Holden that the EVA maneuvering pack had enough thrust to overcome the stationâ€™s spin and get them back up to an airlock.</p>
      <p>No one spoke. Holden had expected banter. Heâ€™d expected to want to banter. But the damaged Roci seemed to call for silence. Maybe awe.</p>
      <p>Holden leaned against the cargo bay bulkhead and closed his eyes. The only sounds he could hear were the steady hiss of his air supply and the faint static of the comm. He could smell nothing through his broken and blood-clogged nose, and his mouth was filled with a coppery taste. But even so, he couldnâ€™t keep a smile off his face.</p>
      <p>Theyâ€™d won. Theyâ€™d flown right up to Protogen, taken everything the evil bastards could throw at them, and bloodied their noses. Even now OPA soldiers were storming their station, shooting the people whoâ€™d helped kill Eros.</p>
      <p>Holden decided that he was okay with not feeling any remorse for them. The moral complexity of the situation had grown past his ability to process it, so he just relaxed in the warm glow of victory insteadhe wa f.</p>
      <p>The comm chirped and Amos said, â€œReady to move.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden nodded, remembered he was still in his atmosphere suit, and said, â€œOkay. Hook on, everyone.â€�</p>
      <p>He, Alex, and Naomi pulled tethers from their suits and clamped them to Amosâ€™ broad waist. Amos cycled the cargo airlock and flew out the door on puffs of gas. They were immediately hurled away from the ship by station spin, but Amos quickly got them under control and flew back up toward Thothâ€™s emergency airlock.</p>
      <p>As Amos flew them past the Roci, Holden studied the outside of the ship and tried to catalog repair requirements. There were a dozen holes in both her bow and aft that corresponded to holes all along the inside of the ship. The gauss cannon rounds the interceptor had fired probably hadnâ€™t even slowed appreciably on their path through the Roci. The crew was just lucky none of them had found the reactor and punched a hole in it.</p>
      <p>There was also a huge dent in the false superstructure that made the ship look like a compressed gas freighter. Holden knew it would match an equally ugly wound in the armored outer hull. The damage hadnâ€™t extended to the inner hull, or the ship would have cracked in two.</p>
      <p>With the damage to the airlock, and the total loss of their oxygen storage tanks and recycling systems, there would be millions of dollars in damage and weeks in dry dock, assuming they could make it to a dry dock somewhere.</p>
      <p>Maybe the Molinari could give them a tow.</p>
      <p>Amos flashed the EVA packâ€™s yellow warning lights three times, and the stationâ€™s emergency airlock door cycled open. He flew them inside, where four Belters in combat armor waited.</p>
      <p>As soon as the airlock finished cycling, Holden pulled his helmet off and touched his nose. It felt twice its normal size and throbbed with every heartbeat.</p>
      <p>Naomi reached out and held his face still, her thumbs on either side of his nose, her touch surprisingly gentle. She turned his head from side to side, examining the injury, then let go.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™ll be crooked without some cosmetic surgery,â€� she said. â€œBut you were too pretty before anyway. Itâ€™ll give your face character.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden felt a slow grin coming on, but before he could reply, one of the OPA troops started talking.</p>
      <p>â€œWatched the fight, hermano. You guys really kicked some ass.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThanks,â€� said Alex. â€œHowâ€™s it goinâ€™ in here?â€�</p>
      <p>The soldier with the most stars on his OPA insignia said, â€œLess resistance than expected, but the Protogen securityâ€™s been fighting for every foot of real estate. Even some of the egg-heads have been coming at us. Weâ€™ve had to shoot a few.â€�</p>
      <p>He pointed at the inner airlock door.</p>
      <p>â€œFredâ€™s heading up to ops. Wants you people up there, pronto.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œLead the way,â€� Holden replied, his nose turning it into lee da way.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œHowâ€™s that leg, Cap?â€� Amos asked as they walked along the station corridor. Holden realized heâ€™d forgotten about the limp his gunshot to the calf had left him.</p>
      <p>â€œDoesn="1em kâ€œâ€™t hurt, but the muscle doesnâ€™t flex as much,â€� he replied. â€œYours?â€�</p>
      <p>Amos grinned and glanced down at the leg that still limped from the fracture heâ€™d suffered on the Donnager months earlier.</p>
      <p>â€œNo biggie,â€� he said. â€œThe ones that donâ€™t kill you donâ€™t count.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden started to reply, then stopped when the group rounded a corner into a slaughterhouse. They were clearly coming up behind the assault team, because now the corridor floor was littered with bodies, the walls with bullet holes and scorch marks. To his relief, Holden saw a lot more bodies in Protogen security armor than in OPA gear. But there were enough dead Belters on the floor to make his stomach twist. When he passed a dead man in a lab coat, he had to stop himself from spitting on the floor. The security guys had maybe made a bad decision in going to work for the wrong team, but the scientists on this station had killed a million and a half people just to see what would happen. They couldnâ€™t be dead enough for Holdenâ€™s comfort.</p>
      <p>Something tugged at him, and he paused. Lying next to the dead scientist was what looked like a kitchen knife.</p>
      <p>â€œHuh,â€� Holden said. â€œHe didnâ€™t come at you guys with that, did he?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, crazy, no?â€� said one of their escorts. â€œI heard of bringing a knife to a gunfight, butâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOps is up ahead,â€� said the ranking trooper. â€œGeneralâ€™s waiting.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Holden entered the stationsâ€™ ops center and saw Fred, Miller, a bunch of OPA troops, and one stranger in an expensive-looking suit. A line of technicians and operations staff in Protogen uniform had their wrists cuffed and were being led away. The room was covered deck to ceiling in screens and monitors, most of which were spooling text data too fast to read.</p>
      <p>â€œLet me get this straight,â€� Fred was saying. â€œYouâ€™ll give me all the kingdoms of the Earth if I just bow down and do one act of worship for you?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know the reference,â€� the stranger said.</p>
      <p>Whatever else they were about to say stopped when Miller noticed Holden and tapped Fred on the shoulder. Holden could swear that the detective gave him a warm smile, though on his dour face it was hard to tell.</p>
      <p>â€œJim,â€� Fred said, then gestured for him to come closer. He was reading a matte black business card. â€œMeet Antony Dresden, executive VP of bio research for Protogen, and the architect of the Eros project.â€�</p>
      <p>The asshole in the suit actually reached out like he was going to shake hands. Holden ignored him.</p>
      <p>â€œFred,â€� he said. â€œCasualties?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œShockingly low.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHalf their security had non-lethals,â€� Miller said. â€œRiot control. Sticky rounds. Like that.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden nodded and then shook his head and frowned.</p>
      <p>â€œI saw a lot of Protogen security bodies out there in the corridor. Why have so many guys and then give them weapons that canâ€™t repel boarders?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGood question,â€� Miller agreed.</p>
      <p>Dresden chuckled.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is whatalign k is I mean, Mr. Johnson,â€� Dresden said. He turned to Holden. â€œJim? Well then, Jim. The fact that you donâ€™t understand this stationâ€™s security needs tells me that you have no idea what youâ€™ve become involved with. And I think you know that as well as I do. As I was saying to Fred hereâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAntony, you need to shut the fuck up,â€� Holden said, surprised by the sudden flush of anger. Dresden looked disappointed.</p>
      <p>The bastard had no right to be comfortable. Condescending. Holden wanted the man terrified, begging for his life, not sneering behind his cultured accent.</p>
      <p>â€œAmos, if he talks to me again without being told to, break his jaw.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMy pleasure, Captain,â€� Amos said, and took half a step forward.</p>
      <p>Dresden smirked at the ham-fisted threat but kept his mouth shut.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat do we know?â€� Holden asked, aiming the question at Fred.</p>
      <p>â€œWe know the Eros data is coming here, and we know this piece of shit is in charge. Weâ€™ll know more once weâ€™ve taken the place apart.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden turned to look at Dresden again, taking in the blue blood European good looks, the gym-sculpted physique, the expensive haircut. Even now, surrounded by men with guns, Dresden managed to look like he was in charge. Holden could imagine him glancing down at his watch and wondering how much more of his expensive time this boarding party was going to take.</p>
      <p>Holden said, â€œI need to ask him something.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred nodded. â€œYou earned it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy?â€� Holden asked. â€œI want to know why.â€�</p>
      <p>Dresdenâ€™s smile was almost pitying, and he stuck his hands into his pockets as casually as a man talking sports at a dockside bar.</p>
      <p>â€œ â€˜Whyâ€™ is a very big question,â€� Dresden said. â€œBecause God wanted it that way? Or perhaps you want to narrow it for me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy Eros?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWell, Jimâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou can call me Captain Holden. Iâ€™m the guy that found your lost ship, so Iâ€™ve seen the video from Phoebe. I know what the protomolecule is.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œReally!â€� Dresden said, his smile becoming half a degree more genuine. â€œI have you to thank for turning the viral agent over to us on Eros. Losing the Anubis was going to put our timeline back months. Finding the infected body already there on the station was a godsend.â€�</p>
      <p>I knew it. I fucking knew it, Holden thought. Out loud, he said, â€œWhy?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou know what the agent is,â€� Dresden said, at a loss for the first time since Holden had come into the room. â€œI donâ€™t know what more I can tell you. This is the most important thing to ever happen to the human race. Itâ€™s simultaneously proof that we are not alone in the universe, and our ticket out of the limitations that bind us to our little bubbles of rock and air.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou arenâ€™t answering me,â€� Holden said, hating the way his broken nose made his voice slightly comical when he wanted to be threatening. â€œI want to know why you killed a million and a half people.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred cleared his throat, but he didnâ€™t interrupt. Dresden looked from Holden to the colonel and back again.</p>
      <p>â€œI am answering, Captain. Aam kpta million and a half people is small potatoes. What weâ€™re working with here is bigger than that,â€� Dresden said, then moved over to a chair and sat down, pulling up his pants leg as he crossed his knees, so as not to stretch the fabric. â€œAre you familiar with Genghis Khan?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Holden and Fred said at almost the same instant. Miller only stared at Dresden with a blank expression, tapping the barrel of his pistol against his own armored thigh.</p>
      <p>â€œGenghis Khan. There are some historians who claim that Genghis Kahn killed or displaced one quarter of the total human population of Earth during his conquest,â€� Dresden said. â€œHe did that in pursuit of an empire that would begin falling apart as soon as he died. In todayâ€™s scale, that would mean killing nearly ten billion people in order to affect a generation. A generation and a half. Eros isnâ€™t even a rounding error by comparison.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou really donâ€™t care,â€� Fred said, his voice quiet.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd unlike Khan, we arenâ€™t doing it to build a brief empire. I know what you think. That weâ€™re trying to aggrandize ourselves. Grab power.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t want to?â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œOf course we do.â€� Dresdenâ€™s voice was cutting. â€œBut youâ€™re thinking too small. Building humanityâ€™s greatest empire is like building the worldâ€™s largest anthill. Insignificant. There is a civilization out there that built the protomolecule and hurled it at us over two billion years ago. They were already gods at that point. What have they become since then? With another two billion years to advance?â€�</p>
      <p>With a growing dread, Holden listened to Dresden speak. This speech had the air of something spoken before. Perhaps many times. And it had worked. It had convinced powerful people. It was why Protogen had stealth ships from the Earth shipyards and seemingly limitless behind-the-scenes support.</p>
      <p>â€œWe have a terrifying amount of catching up to do, gentlemen,â€� Dresden was saying. â€œBut fortunately we have the tool of our enemy to use in doing it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCatching up?â€� a soldier to Holdenâ€™s left said. Dresden nodded at the man and smiled.</p>
      <p>â€œThe protomolecule can alter the host organism at the molecular level; it can create genetic change on the fly. Not just DNA, but any stable replicator. But it is only a machine. It doesnâ€™t think. It follows instructions. If we learn how to alter that programming, then we become the architects of that change.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden interrupted. â€œIf it was supposed to wipe out life on Earth and replace it with whatever the protomoleculeâ€™s creators wanted, why turn it loose?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œExcellent question,â€� Dresden said, holding up one finger like a college professor about to deliver a lecture. â€œThe protomolecule doesnâ€™t come with a userâ€™s manual. In fact, weâ€™ve never before been able to actually watch it carry out its program. The molecule requires significant mass before it develops enough processing power to fulfill its directives. Whatever they are.â€�</p>
      <p>Dresden pointed at the screens covered with data around them.</p>
      <p>â€œWe are going to watch it at work. See what it intends to do. How it goes about doing it. And, hopefully, learn how to change that program in the process.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou could do that with a vat of bacteria,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not interested in remaking bacteria,â€� Dresdein re k� Dn said.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re fucking insane,â€� Amos said, and took another step toward Dresden. Holden put a hand on the big mechanicâ€™s shoulder.</p>
      <p>â€œSo,â€� Holden said. â€œYou figure out how the bug works, and then what?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThen everything. Belters who can work outside a ship without wearing a suit. Humans capable of sleeping for hundreds of years at a time flying colony ships to the stars. No longer being bound to the millions of years of evolution inside one atmosphere of pressure at one g, slaves to oxygen and water. We decide what we want to be, and we reprogram ourselves to be that. Thatâ€™s what the protomolecule gives us.â€�</p>
      <p>Dresden had stood back up as heâ€™d delivered this speech, his face shining with the zeal of a prophet.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat we are doing is the best and only hope of humanityâ€™s survival. When we go out there, we will be facing gods.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd if we donâ€™t go out?â€� Fred asked. He sounded thoughtful.</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™ve already fired a doomsday weapon at us once,â€� Dresden said.</p>
