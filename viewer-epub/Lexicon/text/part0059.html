			<p class="x13-BM-Ack-Head">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Acknowledgments used to be rare glimpses inside the author’s mind when he/she wasn’t trying to lie to you. Stephen King had some of the best. They were long and rambling, like you’d caught him after dinner and a few glasses of wine. I grew up in rural Australia, the nearest bookstore a town away, and Stephen King never toured there, not even on a motorcycle<a href="part0061.html#footnote-27168-2" id="footnote-27168-2-backlink">*</a>. I didn’t even realize authors did tours. Acknowledgments were all I had. They were blogs, before blogs were a thing.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Now blogs are a thing, and tweets, and you never need to wonder what any author thinks about anything. Which is a little sad, I feel, for Acknowledgments. They’ve been reduced to a parade of names. Important names, if you are the author, or one of the names. The names are the reason we have Acknowledgments. But still. I liked the rambles.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">My important names begin with the usual suspects: those people who read my first drafts and then, six months later, my second drafts (“Try to pretend like you don’t know what’s going to happen”), and so on, for far too long. You might think this doesn’t sound too bad, getting a sneak peek at a book, but that’s because you don’t realize how terribly broken my drafts are. Imagine your favorite story, only every so often the characters do stupid things for no reason and then nothing ends like it should. It’s horrible, right? It’s not merely <em class="calibre1">less good</em>; it ruins the whole thing. I am very grateful to those people who let me ruin stories for them, especially Todd Keithley, Charles Thiesen, Kassy Humphries, Jason Laker, Jo Keron, and John Schoenfelder.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Thank you to everyone who keeps publishing me. Many people put a great deal of work into each and every book, and if they do a good job, the author gets all the credit. There are editors and marketing people, assistants and copy editors, translators and salespeople, buyers and bookstore employees, designers and techs, and plenty more. Thank you for all the times you did a little more than you had to. In particular, thanks to my U.S. and UK editors, Colin Dickerman and Ruth Tross, who steered me through the final draft with insight and precision, which is like a gift to an author.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Luke Janklow is my go-to guy, literary agent by name, guardian angel by nature. I don’t know what I’d do without him, but I bet it would suck. Claire Dippel, the wind beneath Luke’s wings, can do just about anything, apparently, while remaining bright and good-natured. Almost suspiciously so. Thank you, both.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Most of all, thank you, Jen, for making this possible. There isn’t a single piece of this that works without you. Not the book, not the writing, not me. Definitely not me.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">And, hey. You. Thanks for being the kind of person who likes to pick up a book. That’s a genuinely great thing. I met a librarian recently who said she doesn’t read because books are her job and when she goes home, she just wants to switch off. I think we can agree that that’s as creepy as hell. Thank you for seeking out stories, the kind that take place in your brain.</p>
