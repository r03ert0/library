      <h2>They better have, Miller thought. It wasnâ€™t a big moon....</h2>
      <p>â€œTu sabez?â€� Diogo said. â€œTheyâ€™re on our side now. They get it. Mars-OPA alliance.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t really think that,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œNah,â€� Diogo said, just as pleased with himself in admitting that the hope was fragile at best and probably false. â€œBut donâ€™t hurt to dream, que no?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t think?â€� Miller said, and lay back.</p>
      <p>The acceleration gel was too stiff to conform to his body at the dockâ€™s one-third g, but it wasnâ€™t uncomfortable. He checked the news on his hand terminal, and indeed someone in the Martian navy had made a judgment call. It was a lot of ordinance to use, especially in the middle of a shooting war, but theyâ€™d expended it. Saturn had one fewer moon, one more tiny, unformed, filamentous ringâ€”if there was even enough matter left from the detonations to form that. It looked to Millerâ€™s unpracticed eye as if the explosions had been designed to drop debris into the protective and crushing gravity of the gas giant.</p>
      <p>It was foolish to think it meant the Martian government wouldnâ€™t want samples of the protomolecule. It was naive to pretend that any organization of that size and complexity was univocal about anything, much less something as dangerous and transforming as this.</p>
      <p>But still.</p>
      <p>Perhaps it was enough just knowing that someone on the other side of the political and military divide had seen the same evidence they had seen and drawn the same conclusions. Maybe it left room for hope. He switched his hand terminal back to the Eros feed. A strong throbbing sound danced below a cascade of noise. Voices rose and fell and rose again. Data streams spewed into one another, and the pattern-recognition servers burned every spare cycle making something from the resultant mess. Julie took his hand, the dream so convincing he could almost pretend he felt it.</p>
      <p>You belong with me, she said.</p>
      <p>As soon as itâ€™s over, he thought. It was true he kept pushing back the end point of the case. First find Julie, then avenge her, and now destroy the project that had claimed her life. But after that was accomplished, he could let go.</p>
      <p>He just had this one last thing he needed to do.</p>
      <p>Twenty minutes later, the Klaxon sounded. Thirty minutes later, the engines kicked on, pressing him into the acceleration gel at a joint-crushing high-g burn for thirteen days, with one-g breaks for biological function every four hours. And when they were done, the half-trained jack-of-all-trades crew would be handling nuclear mines capable of annihilating them if they screwed it up.</p>
      <p>But at least Julie would be there. Not really, but still.</p>
      <p>It didnâ€™t hurt to dream.</p>
      <p>Chapter Forty-Seven: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Even the wet cellulose taste of reconstituted artificial scrambled eggs was not enough to ruin Holdenâ€™s warm, self-satisfied glow. He shoveled the faux eggs into his mouth, trying not to grin. Sitting at his left around the galley table, Amos ate with lip-smacking enthusiasm. To Holdenâ€™s right, Alex pushed the limp eggs around on his plate with a piece of equally fake toast. Across the table, Naomi sipped a cup of tea and looked at him from under her hair. He stifled the urge to wink at her.</p>
      <p>Theyâ€™d talked about how to break the news to the crew but hadnâ€™t come to any consensus. Holden hated to hide anything. Keeping it secret made it seem dirty or shameful. His parents had raised him to believe that sex was something you did in private not because it was embarrassing, but because it was intimate. With five fathers and three mothers, the sleeping arrangements were always complex at his house, but the discussions about who was bedding with whom were never hidden from him. It left him with a strong aversion to hiding his own activities.</p>
      <p>Naomi, on the other hand, thought they shouldnâ€™t do anything to upset the fragile equilibrium theyâ€™d found, and Holden trusted her instincts. She had an insight into group dynamics that he often lacked. So, for now, he was following her lead.</p>
      <p>Besides, it would have felt like boasting, and that would have been rude.</p>
      <p>Keeping his voice neutral and professional, he said, â€œNaomi, can you pass the pepper?â€�</p>
      <p>Amosâ€™ head snapped up, and he dropped his fork on the table with a loud clatter.</p>
      <p>â€œHoly shit, you guys are doing it!â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUm,â€� Holden said. â€œWhat?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSomethingâ€™s been screwy ever since we got back on the Roci, but I couldnâ€™t figure. But thatâ€™s it! You guys are finally playing hide the weasel.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden blinked twice at the big mechanic, unsure of what to say. He glanced at Naomi for support, but her head was down, and her hair completely covered her face. Her shoulders were shaking in silent laughter.</p>
      <p>â€œJesus, Cap,â€� Amos said, a grin on his wide face. â€œIt fucking took you long enough. If sheâ€™d been throwing herself at me like that, Iâ€™d have been neck deep in that shit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUh,â€� Alex said, looking shocked enough that it was clear he hadnâ€™t shared Amosâ€™ insights. â€œWow.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi stopped laughing and wiped tears away from the corners of her eyes.</p>
      <p>â€œBusted,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>â€œLook. Guys, itâ€™s important that you know this doesnâ€™t affect ourâ€”â€� Holden said, but Amos cut him off with a snort.</p>
      <p>â€œHey, Alex,â€� ign="jœIt…Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œYo,â€� Alex replied.</p>
      <p>â€œXO boning the captain going to make you a really shitty pilot?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t believe it will,â€� Alex said with a grin, exaggerating his drawl.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd, oddly enough, I donâ€™t feel the need to be a lousy mechanic.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden tried again. â€œI think itâ€™s important thatâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCapâ€™n?â€� Amos continued, ignoring him. â€œConsider that no one gives a fuck, it wonâ€™t stop us from doing our jobs, and just enjoy it, since weâ€™ll probably all be dead in a few days anyway.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi started laughing again.</p>
      <p>â€œFine,â€� she said. â€œI mean, everyone knows Iâ€™m only doing it to get a promotion. Oh, wait, right. Already the second-in-command. Hey, can I be captain now?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Holden said, laughing. â€œItâ€™s a shit job. Iâ€™d never ask you to do it.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi grinned and shrugged. See? Iâ€™m not always right. Holden glanced at Alex, who was looking at him with genuine affection, clearly happy about the idea of him and Naomi together. Everything seemed right.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Eros spun like a potato-shaped top, its thick skin of rock hiding the horrors inside. Alex brought them in close to do a thorough scan of the station. The asteroid swelled on Holdenâ€™s screen until it looked close enough to touch. At the other ops station, Naomi swept the surface with ladar, looking for anything that might pose a danger to the Tycho freighter crews, still a few days behind. On Holdenâ€™s tactical display, the UNN science ship continued to flare in a braking maneuver toward Eros, its escort right beside it.</p>
      <p>â€œStill not talking, huh?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>Naomi shook her head, then tapped on her screen and sent the commâ€™s monitoring information to his workstation.</p>
      <p>â€œNope,â€� she said. â€œBut they see us. Theyâ€™ve been bouncing radar off of us for a couple hours now.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair and thought about the choices. It was possible that the hull modifications Tycho had made to the Roci were fooling the Earth corvetteâ€™s recognition software. They might just ignore the Roci, thinking she was a Belter gas runner that happened to be hanging around. But the Roci was running without a transponder, which made her illegal no matter what hull configuration she was showing. That the corvette wasnâ€™t trying to warn off a ship that was running dark made him nervous. The Belt and the inner planets were in a shooting war. A Belter ship with no identification was hanging around Eros while two Earth ships flew toward it. No way any captain with half a brain would just ignore them.</p>
      <p>The corvetteâ€™s silence meant something else.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi, I have a feeling that corvette is going to try and blow us up,â€� Holden said with a sigh.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s what Iâ€™d do,â€� she replied.</p>
      <p>Holden tapped one last complicated rhythm on his chair, then put his headset on.</p>
      <p>â€œAll right, I guess I make the first overture, then,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>Not wishing to make their ify">Nhimtheir iconversation public, Holden targeted the Earther corvette with the Rocinanteâ€™s laser array and signaled a generic linkup request. After a few seconds, the link established light went green, and his earplugs began to hiss with faint background static. Holden waited, but the UN ship offered no greeting. They wanted him to speak first.</p>
      <p>He flicked off his mic, switching to the shipwide comm.</p>
      <p>â€œAlex, get us moving. One g for now. If I canâ€™t bluff this guy, itâ€™ll be a shooting match. Be ready to open her up.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRoger,â€� drawled Alex. â€œGoinâ€™ on the juice, just in case.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden glanced over at Naomiâ€™s station, but sheâ€™d already switched to her tactical screen and had the Roci plotting firing solutions and jamming tactics on the two approaching ships. Naomi had been in only one battle, but she was reacting now like a seasoned veteran. He smiled at her back, then turned around before she had time to realize he was staring.</p>
      <p>â€œAmos?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œLocked down and shipshape down here, Cap. The Rociâ€™s pawing at the turf. Letâ€™s go kick some ass.â€�</p>
      <p>Letâ€™s hope we donâ€™t have to, Holden thought.</p>
      <p>He turned his mic back on.</p>
      <p>â€œThis is Captain James Holden of the Rocinante, calling the captain of the approaching United Nations Navy corvette, call sign unknown. Please respond.â€�</p>
      <p>There was a static-filled pause, followed by â€œRocinante. Leave our flight path immediately. If you do not begin moving away from Eros at best possible speed, you will be fired upon.â€�</p>
      <p>The voice was young. An aging corvette with the tedious task of following an asteroid-mapping ship around wouldnâ€™t be a much sought after command. The captain was probably a lieutenant without patrons or prospects. Heâ€™d be inexperienced, but he might see a confrontation as an opportunity to prove himself to his superiors. And that made the next few moments treacherous to navigate.</p>
      <p>â€œSorry,â€� said Holden. â€œStill donâ€™t know your call sign, or your name. But I canâ€™t do what you want. In fact, I canâ€™t let anyone land on Eros. Iâ€™m going to need you to stop approaching the station.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œRocinante, I donâ€™t think youâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>Holden took control of the Rociâ€™s targeting system and began painting the approaching corvette with its targeting laser.</p>
      <p>â€œLet me explain whatâ€™s happening here,â€� he said. â€œRight now, youâ€™re looking at your sensors, and youâ€™re seeing what looks like a thrown-together gas freighter thatâ€™s giving your ship-recognition software fits. And all of a sudden, meaning right now, itâ€™s painting you with a state-of-the-art target-acquisition system.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe donâ€™tâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t lie. I know thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening. So hereâ€™s the deal. Despite how it looks, my ship is newer, faster, tougher, and better armed than yours. The only way for me to really prove that is to open fire, and Iâ€™m hoping not to do that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAre you threatening me, Rocinante?â€� the young voice on Holdenâ€™s headset said, its tone hitting just the right notes of arrogance and disbelief.</p>
      <p>â€œYou? No,â€� said Holden. â€œIâ€™m threatening the big, fat, slow-moving, and unarmed ship youâ€™re ing, aip-â€™re isupposed to be protecting. You keep flying toward Eros, and I will unload everything Iâ€™ve got at it. I guarantee we will blow that flying science lab out of the sky. Now, itâ€™s possible you might get us while we do it, but by then your mission is screwed anyway, right?â€�</p>
      <p>The line went silent again, only the hiss of background radiation letting him know his headset hadnâ€™t died.</p>
      <p>When his answer came, it came on the shipwide comms.</p>
      <p>Alex said, â€œTheyâ€™re stoppinâ€™, Captain. They just started hard brakinâ€™. Tracking says theyâ€™ll be relative stopped about two million klicks out. Want me to keep flyinâ€™ toward â€™em?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, bring us back to our stationary position over Eros,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>â€œRoger that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNaomi,â€� Holden said, spinning his chair around to face her. â€œAre they doing anything else?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot that I can see through the clutter of their exhaust. But they could be tightbeaming messages the other direction and weâ€™d never know,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>Holden flipped the shipwide comm off. He scratched his head for a minute, then unbuckled his restraints.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, we stopped them for now. Iâ€™m going to hit the head and then grab a drink. Want anything?â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>â€œHeâ€™s not wrong, you know,â€� Naomi said later that night.</p>
      <p>Holden was floating in zero g on the ops deck, his station a few feet away. Heâ€™d turned down the deck lights, and the cabin was as dim as a moonlit night. Alex and Amos were sleeping two decks below. They might as well have been a million light-years away. Naomi was floating near her own station, two meters away, her hair unbound and drifting around her like a black cloud. The panel behind her lit her face in profile: the long forehead, flat nose, large lips. He could tell that her eyes were closed. He felt like they were the only two people in the universe.</p>
      <p>â€œWhoâ€™s not wrong?â€� he said, just to be saying something.</p>
      <p>â€œMiller,â€� she replied as though it were obvious.</p>
      <p>â€œI have no idea what youâ€™re talking about.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi laughed, then swatted with one hand to rotate her body and face him in the air. Her eyes were open now, though with the panel lights behind her, they were visible only as black pools in her face.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve been thinking about Miller,â€� she said. â€œI treated him badly on Tycho. Ignored him because you were angry. I owed him better than that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHe saved your life on Eros.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden snorted, but she kept going anyway.</p>
      <p>â€œWhen you were in the navy,â€� she finally said, â€œwhat were you supposed to do when someone went crazy on the ship? Started doing things that endangered everyone?â€�</p>
      <p>Thinking they were talking about Miller, Holden said, â€œYou restrain him and remove him as a danger to the ship and crew. But Fred didnâ€™tâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi cut him off.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat if itâ€™s wartime?â€� she said. â€œThe middle of a battle?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf he canâ€™t be easily restrained, the chief of the watch has an obligation to protect the ship and crew by whatever means necessary.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œEven shooting him?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf thatâ€™s the only way to do it,â€� Holden replied. â€œSure. But it would only be in the most pressing circumstances.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi nodded with her hand, sending her body slowly twisting the other way. She stopped her motion with one unconscious gesture. Holden was pretty good in zero g, but heâ€™d never be that good.</p>
      <p>â€œThe Belt is a network,â€� Naomi said. â€œItâ€™s like one big distributed ship. We have nodes that make air, or water, or power, or structural materials. Those nodes may be separated by millions of kilometers of space, but that doesnâ€™t make them any less interconnected.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI see where this is going,â€� Holden said with a sigh. â€œDresden was a madman on the ship, Miller shot him to protect the rest of us. He gave me that speech back on Tycho. Didnâ€™t buy it then either.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBecause,â€� Holden said. â€œDresden wasnâ€™t an immediate threat. He was just an evil little man in an expensive suit. He didnâ€™t have a gun in his hand, or his finger on a bomb trigger. And I will never trust a man who believes he has the right to unilaterally execute people.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden put his foot against the bulkhead and tapped off just hard enough to float a few feet closer to Naomi, close enough to see her eyes, read her reaction to him.</p>
