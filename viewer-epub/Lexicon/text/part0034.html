			<p class="x03-Chapter-Number">[FIVE]</p>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Wil adjusted the shade for the millionth time, trying to block the sun that sat low over the road, bellowing anger. “It’s so hot.” He looked at Eliot. Eliot didn’t care. Eliot had been near-silent since Minneapolis, when Wil accused him of being the same as Woolf. He presumed Eliot was stewing, although of course Wil would never know, because Eliot was as readable as a brick.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The car jolted over a pothole. They were taking the back way to Broken Hill, riding in a ridiculous purple Valiant, wide and loud, easily thirty years old. No air, of course. Many years ago, the dash had split under the merciless pounding of the sun and begun to ooze yellow foam. The speedometer read in miles. It was a miracle it had seat belts. They were probably getting three miles to the gallon. He watched leafless trees drift by. After eight hours in an oven made of metal and glass, heat had penetrated every pore of his body. He just wanted to get out of the car. He just wanted Eliot to say something. “Have you been out here before?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">No reply. Wil looked out at the baked earth that rolled all the way to the horizon, flat as a plate. He, Wil, had been out here before. He had lived in Broken Hill. Apparently. He didn’t remember. It was hard to believe he could have forgotten this heat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” said Eliot. It took Wil a moment to remember the question.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Before or after?” Eliot didn’t respond. “You know. Before or after?” Still nothing. “Or both?” He sighed and began to fiddle with the vents.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop that. You’re not making it better.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked at him. “I’m just—”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Leave the vents alone.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He sat back. Eliot was definitely pissed. A sign blew by the window, announcing a turnoff for Menindee. “We should get some fuel.” The intersection crawled toward them. “Eliot? Only thirty kilometers. Menindee. Eliot? Do you know how far apart the gas stations are? Seriously, you run out of petrol on a road like this, you die. It happens.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The intersection slid past. Wil slouched. He understood that Eliot didn’t want to stop. The airport had been hairy. They had made it through Immigration, then a short, dark-skinned official had emerged from nowhere, asking them to please step out of the line. Wil had been deposited in a small, windowless room and left for twenty minutes, staring at a security camera. It seemed increasingly obvious to him they’d been recognized, but he wasn’t sure what he should do about that. So he waited. Eventually, the door opened. It was Eliot. People were arguing in the corridor, loud Australian voices. “Are we okay?” Wil had asked, and Eliot didn’t say anything, but the answer was clearly no. They found a cab. He could hear rising police sirens. But then there had been nothing but a lot of uneventful driving.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyes were closing when there was a flat bang and the car lurched. “What,” he said, thinking pursuit, death. Eliot steered the car onto the shoulder. Dust billowed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A flat,” said Eliot. He popped open the door. Wil sat for a moment before remembering the promise of fresh air and heaving himself from the seat. His knees popped violently. The air was like fire, but at least it was moving. He strode around the car, swinging his arms. “Oh, yeah,” he said. It felt good to do something.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot dragged a spare tire from the trunk. Wil shielded his eyes to study the landscape. There was nothing. Just a vast canyon of air. His eyes grew restless for something to latch on to.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He heard Eliot grunting. “Need a hand?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot glanced at him, his face flushed. “They’re rusted on.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The lug nuts?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Doesn’t matter. We can drive on it.” Eliot stood.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Did you pull hard enough?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes,” said Eliot. “I pulled hard enough.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Give me a try.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot rolled the tire back to the trunk. “Forget it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“For fuck’s sake. I’m not useless.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This isn’t one of those games where everybody gets a turn. Get in the car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I will be two fucking minutes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Get in the car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot looked at him expressionlessly. “Fine.” He tossed Wil the wrench.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil pulled off his T-shirt and knelt before the jacked-up wheel. There was a lot of rust here. He wiggled the wrench onto the top nut and tested it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well?” said Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He swiped his arm across his forehead. “Just warming up.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have a time issue.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Jesus, you don’t even think I can change a tire.” He strained against the wrench. “I can do this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Some time passed. “Okay,” Eliot said. “Enough.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’ve almost got it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You haven’t. You’re just wasting time.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He strained. Something went <em class="calibre1">crack</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re going to strip it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The lug nut squealed. He forced it through a revolution, and then it got easy. He unscrewed the nut and dropped it to the ground. He had a tremendous urge to glance at Eliot’s face and couldn’t resist it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Congratulations,” said Eliot. “Unfortunately, there are three more.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He braced his foot against the tire well. “You <em class="calibre1">want</em> me to be useless. You love being in control of everything while I stumble around with no idea what I’m doing.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No, that’s the opposite of what I want. What I want is to get to Broken Hill as soon as possible, and for you to make a net positive contribution to that goal.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He released the wrench and bent to inspect the next lug nut. It looked very corroded. He hefted the wrench and began to bang at it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“This has moved into farce,” Eliot said. “Get into the car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The lug nut spat rust. He got the wrench around it and forced it around. “That’s two.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Great,” said Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You need to loosen up,” Wil said. “You seriously need to take a fucking breath and consider that you’re not the only guy who can do everything.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Did you tell me to loosen up?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He wiggled the wrench onto the third nut. “Is that funny for some reason?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When I experience base physiological needs for food, water, air, sleep, and sex, I follow protocols in order to satisfy them without experiencing desire. Yes, it’s funny.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You fucking what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s required to maintain a defense against compromise. Desire is weakness. I’m sure I explained this.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Well, that sounds awesome. That sounds like a terrific life you have there, Eliot.” The nut loosened. “Got you!” he said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You want to see what happens when desire overpowers discipline? Get in the car. We’ll be there in about two hours.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And you didn’t stop it.” The final lug nut was so rusted he had trouble getting the wrench around it. “You and your protocols weren’t good enough to save my town.” He found traction and pulled. “Watch me budge this lug nut, despite my complete lack of discipline.” His muscles burned. Sweat coursed down his back.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stop that. You’re going to pull the whole car off the jack.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And what about <em class="calibre1">Brontë</em>? Twenty years and you never made a move, did you? I bet you never even held her hand.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Get in the car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He grunted but the nut was immovable. He released the wrench, panting. “You know I’m right.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You’re not right,” Eliot said. “You’ve been wrong about everything you’ve opened your mouth to opine upon, up to and including your belief in your ability to change this tire. Get in the car.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He repositioned his feet and gripped the wrench. “I am budging . . . this . . . lug nut!” He pulled with everything he had. His body shook. He yelled. The nut twisted with a squeal and he landed in the dust. He scrambled back to the tire. “Fuck! Yes!” He brandished the nut. “I was right! I was <em class="calibre1">right</em>!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot walked around the car and climbed into the driver’s seat.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ha,” said Wil. He pulled at the tire and it slid off easily. He changed it, collected his shirt, and returned to the passenger seat. Eliot started the engine. He didn’t say anything. Neither did Wil, because this time the silence was fine.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">“I don’t like that chopper,” Eliot said. It was an hour later. Maybe two. It was hard to tell because nothing changed. They were driving on a strip of road that folded around on itself, trapped in an endless loop of blistered blacktop.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil leaned forward and peered through the windshield. A black speck hung in the sky ahead and to the right. “That’s a crop duster. They use helicopters for that out here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Where are the crops?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">A good point. The black speck grew. “I don’t know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Bag on the backseat. Get that.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He twisted in his seat, found an old green and black gym bag, and dragged it into his lap. It clanked. “Is this what I think it is?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“When did you get a gun?” But he knew: It was when Eliot had acquired the car. Wil had emerged from a restroom to find a bearded guy showing Eliot something in the trunk. They had shaken hands. Then they had taken his Valiant.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Take it out of the bag.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not going to shoot some crop-dusting farmer.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m not asking you to shoot anyone. I’m asking you to be prepared.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“See those poles sticking out the sides? Those are for spraying. Spraying crops.” The helicopter drifted over the road and hovered there. The door popped open. Sun glinted on metal. “Or maybe he’s roo hunting,” said Wil. Eliot hit the gas. The roof barked out a flat impact. Hot air tickled Wil’s hair and he looked up to see a small, neat blue hole. The hole was blue because of the sky. He turned and found a second hole in the backseat. “<em class="calibre1">Christ!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The engine roared. Wil saw the needle tip past ninety miles per hour. The road was cracked and potholed, strewn with sand. One bump and they could roll. They could easily become airborne. The chopper flashed overhead and Wil glimpsed a grizzled man in an Akubra with a rifle. When he turned the chopper was rising in the rear window, peeling after them.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay,” said Eliot. “Now I want you to shoot someone.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil pulled the shotgun from the bag, brown plastic molded around double barrels, the kind you had to break open between rounds. He hefted it awkwardly.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Ammunition.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right.” He found loose boxes of shells in the bag and tore one open. The car hit a pothole and began to slide. Shells spilled into the footwell. The car found traction and Wil steadied and broke open the shotgun and forced a shell into each barrel. He cranked the window. Furious wind blasted at his face. He stuck out his head to see the chopper skimming low over the road behind them. The pilot was behind the plastic bubble, hands on the controls, and it seemed to Wil that he wouldn’t be able to steer and shoot simultaneously. He withdrew his head. “Is this guy a poet?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Good question.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I think he’s just some guy!” The car bounced. “They’re controlling him!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Seems likely.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So what do I do?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Shoot him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What? No!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.” Eliot nodded, his eyes on the road. “Right now.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He’s not shooting! He’s just chasing us!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Still. Shoot him.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“He can’t use the fucking gun while he’s flying, Eliot!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I realize! Shoot him!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If he can’t use the gun, and he’s not a poet, why do I have to shoot him?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Because he’s going to fly into us!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh,” said Wil. “Oh!” He stuck his head out the window. The helicopter was rushing toward them, blades thundering. He raised the gun but it was already too late, and he fell back into the car. Eliot braked. The Valiant skidded, coming off the road. Dirt fountained. The world darkened. A rotor blade passed by, a great and terrible force Wil felt in his bones. Everything became noise and dust. Then quiet.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stay down,” said Eliot, after a while.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked at him. Eliot was unbuckling. “What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t move.” He took the shotgun from Wil’s hands, opened the door, and disappeared.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil hunkered down. Time passed. There was a sharp bang and the louder, deeper boom of the shotgun. Wil started to rise, stopped.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The door opened. The shotgun came in, butt first. Wil realized he was meant to take it. Eliot climbed inside and turned the key.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He sat up. “Are you okay?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot took the Valiant back to the road and steered around the helicopter, which no longer looked like an aircraft so much as a randomly distributed collection of scrap metal. There was no sign of the pilot. The car reached sixty-five and then ninety and then 110, a speed that made the windows howl like wolves and every pothole a bomb. The tires slipped and muttered, treacherous. Wil didn’t want to say anything, but the fourth time he thought he was going to die, he couldn’t keep silent.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What are you doing?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hurrying.” Eliot’s voice was odd.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What’s the matter?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A lot depends on you now.” Eliot shook his head. “Fuck.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“In the future, when you need to shoot someone, do it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay. Okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot shook his head. “This was a stupid idea. A stupid fucking idea.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Through Eliot’s side window, Wil noticed a thin plume of dust. “Hey. Another car out there.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You think I like shooting people? I don’t. I do it because it needs to be done. Understand?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Do you realize what happens if we fail? If there’s no one left to stop them?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No. You haven’t told me.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Christ,” said Eliot. “This is ridiculous.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil looked out the window. “That car is going fast. Really fast.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It’s trying to intercept us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is it?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s a surprise, is it? You didn’t think there might be more?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why are you so pissed at me?” He stared at Eliot’s shirt. There was a patch. A darker area. “Did you get shot?” He didn’t reply. “Eliot! Did you get shot?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We have to . . . get you to . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If you say something stupid, I’m going to pop you in your fucking mouth.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Eliot,” he said. “Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I told you to shoot that guy.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” Outside Eliot’s window, the dust plume resolved into a police squad car. “What can I do?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Next time you have to choose between Farmer Joe and the fate of the world, you can put a bullet into Farmer Joe. That’s what you can do.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You can kill Woolf. Can you do that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yeah,” Eliot said. “Sure you can.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The cop car rose in the side window. A sign ahead said <span class="SCAP1">BARRIER HIGHWAY</span> and <span class="SCAP1">STOP</span> and clearly they were going to hit that cop car, Wil saw. “Slow down,” he said, but Eliot didn’t. Instead he dropped the hand brake and spun the wheel and the Valiant began to slide sideways. It crossed the highway, passing in front of the cop car, chewed dirt for a while, and lurched onto the blacktop. Behind them, a siren began to wail.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Find out if that cop is a prole,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“A proselyte. Compromised. Find out if he wants to arrest us or kill us.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How do I do that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How do you think? With the gun!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He wound down the window. The cop car was right there, nudging and whining like an animal in heat. He decided to shoot a tire. But the moment he got the shotgun out the window, the cop car’s engine vented and distance opened between them. Wil retreated inside. “He doesn’t want to get shot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Not compromised,” said Eliot. “Good.” Ahead, Wil saw <span class="SCAP1">BROKEN HILL</span> 8 and <span class="SCAP1">NO ENTRY</span> and <span class="SCAP1">QUARANTINE ZONE</span> and <span class="SCAP1">DANGER DEATH</span>. Beyond that, on the horizon, twin sets of twinkling lights like early stars. “Keep him back.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How badly are you hurt?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Badly.” Eliot’s eyes flicked to the rear mirror. “<em class="calibre1">Fucking shit Wil you fuck!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He jerked around. The squad car had slipped lanes and was making a run up the driver’s side. Wil tumbled into the rear of the car. By the time he got upright, the cop car was alongside them. There was a soft thump of contact. The rear of the Valiant began to slide as if it were on ice. The world spun. Wil lost his grip on the shotgun. The Valiant performed one complete revolution and Eliot gunned the engine and it leaped forward again.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He retrieved the shotgun. The cop car was moving up for a repeat performance, a second round of spin-the-Valiant, and there was no time to lower the window, so Wil planted his feet on the side door, aimed the shotgun down his legs, and squeezed the trigger. The window blew out. The cop car jerked as if stung, its engine jumping half a dozen octaves, and fell out of view. Wil leaned out the shattered window into the blast furnace of air. There were two cops in the squad car, their faces pinched with anxiety. He brought the shotgun around, settled on the radiator, and pulled the trigger. The car’s hood popped open. It veered off the road, tires smoking. Wil crawled back inside.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When he reached his own seat, the lights ahead had resolved into two shining squad cars, one in each lane, barreling toward them. “They’re not . . . kamikaze, are they?” Eliot didn’t answer. Wil groped for his seat belt but couldn’t find it. Surely Eliot was about to swerve off the road. The cars ballooned in the windshield, low-slung and powerful. “Eliot! <em class="calibre1">Eliot!</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">One squad car dropped behind the other. They flew past Eliot’s window, their sirens dopplering. Wil breathed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Load that gun,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He dug around the footwell for shells, broke open the shotgun.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re coming around. Keep them back.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t talk about it. Do it.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’m doing it! I just shot a cop car, did you notice?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Next time, shoot the driver.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck!” he said. “What’s the difference?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You shoot the driver, no cop comes within five hundred feet of us, that’s the fucking difference! You shoot the <em class="calibre1">car—</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Okay! Okay!” He got his elbow out the passenger window and levered himself up. The wind tore at him. Way back, a column of white smoke rose from the car he’d shot, stark against the blue sky. Closer, the two new squad cars were eating up the distance between them. Wil steadied the shotgun. He had hunted, once. He’d cleared land like this of rabbits and roos. When was that? He couldn’t remember. But this feeling, the shotgun nestled in his shoulder, an endless landscape of pressed dirt spread before him, was familiar. He waited. The cops would surely see him and stay back. He did not want to shoot anyone.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The Valiant coughed. The car shivered, lurched. Wil clutched at the window frame to avoid falling out of it, almost dropping the gun. “Hey!” he shouted. “What the fuck?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Gas! Becoming an issue!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Why are you <em class="calibre1">shaking the car</em>?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“To extract gas from the tank!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I nearly fell out!” </p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot said something he couldn’t hear over the roar of the wind. </p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Wil leaned inside. “<em class="calibre1">What?</em>”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I said it’s important to keep moving!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I know that! Just give me five seconds of driving in a straight line!” He pushed himself out the window. The squad cars were closer than he liked. At this range, he’d pierce the windshield. They could see that, right? They could see he had a shotgun. He waited for them to back off.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“<em class="calibre1">Shoot!</em>” Eliot yelled.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He aimed at the car on the left and squeezed the trigger. Shot spattered across its hood. Its windshield cracked. Both cars’ noses dipped to the blacktop. Smoke burst from their tires. He watched until there were a good couple hundred yards of road between them. Then he wriggled back inside. “They’re backed off.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Good.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot didn’t ask why he’d fired at the hood. Maybe he didn’t realize. He probably assumed he was a terrible shot. He didn’t know that Wil had hunted. That is, that he remembered hunting. “We seriously need to get you to a hospital.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And how does that work,” said Eliot. “How exactly do we get me to a hospital, in this situation.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I don’t know. But you can’t fucking die, okay? It’s not good for anyone if you die.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hold on,” said Eliot. Wil saw a turnoff rushing toward them, a dusty blacktop guarded by red and black and yellow signs promising <span class="SCAP1">NO ENTRY, ROAD CLOSED, QUARANTINE AREA</span>. As they leaned around the corner, the car coughed explosively. Wil felt a softness enter their momentum. The engine gargled. The Valiant lurched back onto the straight and muttered angrily.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s not good.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“No.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He glanced behind. The squad cars had slipped into a single file. They followed at a distance, taking the turnoff with ease. “They’re going to just sit back there until we run out of gas.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They’re not.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Let me float something,” Wil said. “We stop, they arrest us, we get you some medical attention.” Eliot didn’t say anything. “Then you talk us out. With the word voodoo.” He leaned forward, searching the sky for choppers. “Don’t you think the priority here is you being okay?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The bareword is the priority.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Right. The bareword.” He peered ahead. “There’s something on the road.” A chain-link fence stretched away from either side of the road, but whatever lay between was lost in the heat haze. “Is that a gate?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just loose wire.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you sure?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Pretty sure.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Are you really sure?” he said, but by the time he got the words out, the answer was clear. It was a solid red and yellow barrier. The Valiant plowed through it and a yellow block flew at Wil’s face and ricocheted off the windshield with a light <em class="calibre1">boonk</em>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He looked out the rear window. Colorful blocks rolled slowly across the road.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Plastic,” said Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You said it was wire.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Last time I was here, it was.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The police cars were shrinking. “Hey. They’ve stopped.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s because they believe what they’ve been told about Broken Hill. They don’t want to die.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“So no one will follow us in here? We’re safe?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Regular people won’t. Proles will.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Oh, yeah,” Wil said, dismayed. “Proles.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Also EIPs,” said Eliot. “You haven’t seen those yet. When they show up, we’ll need the word.” He glanced in the rearview mirror. “I’m going to pull over and let you drive for a while.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The car coasted to a halt. Wil ran around the vehicle, hunkering down in case of cops with sniper rifles, or helicopters, or whatever. He didn’t know. It could be anything. The engine stuttered and he thought, <em class="calibre1">Please don’t die, you cock</em>. He pulled open the driver’s side door. Eliot was sitting in the passenger seat like he’d been dropped there. One hand rested on his abdomen. His face was made of paper. The driver’s seat was wet with blood. “Holy crap,” said Wil.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Get in.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His butt pressed into the wet seat. The smell was rich and loamy, like a vegetable garden after rain. “This is seriously bad, Eliot.” He pulled the door closed and set the car to moving before it could capitulate. “Is there a hospital in Broken Hill? A clinic, at least?” He glanced at him, abruptly fearful that he’d died in the past five seconds. But Eliot was still there. “Maybe we can do something for you there.” Maybe Eliot had medical knowledge. Maybe Eliot could dig a bullet out of his body and administer the correct doses of expired medicines. He’d stuck a needle into Wil’s eyeball; he must know something. The engine coughed three times. A structure rose in the distance: something old and industrial. “Are you listening?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Yes. It’s a good plan.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Is it?” But Eliot’s expression suggested otherwise. “Fuck! Then what?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We get the word.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“And?” Eliot said nothing. “What . . .” he began, and forced himself to stop peppering Eliot with questions. He should let Eliot concentrate on holding in his kidneys. A house came up on the right, a squat thing with sun-blistered paint, but he’d seen more run-down places in Portland. It didn’t look abandoned. It was the windows, he realized: They were intact. And there were no weeds, no overgrowth. The sun sterilized everything. He spotted gray-white clumps scattered here and there and thought, <em class="calibre1">Anthills?</em> One was on the road, more distinct. He swerved. “Fuck!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot grunted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Skeletons,” he said. Of course there were skeletons. But still. Skeletons. On the road. A lone gas station came into view. A skeleton hung halfway out of a burned-out station wagon. He glanced at Eliot, to see if Eliot was getting this and was at least a fraction as freaked out as he was, but Eliot’s eyes were closed. “Eliot.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyes opened. He began to shift himself up the seat like he was arranging something heavy. “Don’t. Let me. Close my eyes.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That’s why I said something.” He slowed. There were more skeletons here and he didn’t want to drive over them. He didn’t want to hear the noise. The industrial structure he’d seen earlier was identifiable as a refinery, crouched above the town like a wrecked spaceship. Like it had descended to Earth and murdered everybody. That he could believe. A death ray. A creeping light that spread through the town, disintegrating people. He could understand how something like that could wipe out a town. Not a word. “Eliot!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot opened his eyes.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We’re almost there.” The street signs shone, wind-scrubbed. <span class="SCAP1">SULPHIDE STREET. OPEN CUT MINE</span> #3. It was like they’d wanted to be the site of a toxic catastrophe. Except that hadn’t happened. That was just the story. Something tugged at him, inside his mind. Some memory. “Where’s your word?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hospital,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He glanced at him. “You want the hospital, now?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Word. Is in hospital. Emergency room.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“How do you know that?”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Just do,” Eliot said.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He slowed further, because the road was littered with bones now; there was really no option, and he drove over a gray lump with a sound like splintering tree branches and winced. He saw a library with its steps converted to a ramp by a year and a half of windblown sand. It was hard to believe the skeletons were people. He knew but didn’t. He peered ahead for signs to a hospital. On the right, a fire truck sat embedded in a storefront. Whatever happened out here hadn’t happened quickly. People had had time to flee. Or try. He rolled the car up and down blocks. Some of the skeletons had things. He didn’t want to notice this but it was unavoidable. Flesh rotted but things didn’t. He caught glints of light from rings on finger bones, and belt buckles, and gold hoops, bracelets, earrings. He saw a skull on the sidewalk, a small one. He didn’t want to be here. The feeling rose very suddenly, from somewhere primal.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He saw a café and a real estate office, both of which felt familiar in a far-off, muddied way. He convinced himself to stop avoiding Oxide Street and rolled the Valiant over a thicket of bone. What if a femur splintered and gashed the tires? It probably didn’t matter. The car was near death. Like Eliot. Like himself. They were all very fucking close to death at the moment. It was on all sides.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He saw a blue sign with a white cross. “Eliot! I found it. Stay with me.” The street was a snarl of vehicles, which he threaded the Valiant through. The damage here was worse, every window broken, the bones like snow. Whatever kind of building had been across the road from the hospital was a charred ruin, and this was increasingly the case farther down the street: Maybe half of the little business district had burned. “You say the word is in the emergency room, right?” He was. He didn’t need Eliot to tell him that. He was just trying to keep talking. He saw a sign for <span class="SCAP1">EMERGENCY</span> and squeezed the Valiant between two burned-out pickups. A white paramedic van lay splayed across the curb. Beyond it, he could see wide glass double doors and a red sign. He yanked on the hand brake. Before he could euthanize the car, it burbled and died. “Eliot. We’re here.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot’s head bobbed. “Good.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You want me to help you inside?” He shook his head. “I forgot. You have to stay here. I’ll go look for the word.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Don’t tell you anything about it. Got it.” Eliot nodded. He had been forced to take Wil’s advice: He had loosened up. He had relaxed control. Eliot was no longer in charge. “I’ll be right back.” Wil climbed out.</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</p>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">He wasn’t prepared for the silence. He shut the car door and the sound evaporated. His shoes crunched sand. Hot air closed around him like a fist.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He circumnavigated the paramedic van. The glass emergency room doors were a strange kind of black. Not painted. Stained. He slowed without knowing why. Well. He did know. It was because he was not incredibly keen to face whatever had reduced three thousand human beings to belt buckles and bones. The paramedic van’s rear doors were open. He glanced inside. A flatbed trolley, cloth straps, equipment, little bottles; nothing he wouldn’t expect. But it made his brain crawl. He felt another tickle of familiarity. He hesitated, thinking. Eliot could benefit from some of these supplies. He could use some water. Wil climbed into the van. He gathered anything that looked medicinal and returned to the Valiant with his arms full of supplies. Eliot’s eyes were closed. “Eliot!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">His eyes popped open.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Stay awake.” He dumped his load of bottles onto Eliot’s lap. “I got this stuff for you.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Eliot stared.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Some medicine. And water. You should drink the water.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“What . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“You know, I think you’re right. I did live here. It’s starting to feel familiar.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The fuck,” said Eliot. “Word.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I haven’t gone in yet. I thought you could use this stuff.” Eliot’s eyes bulged. “All right! I’m going! Jesus!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He walked back to the emergency room. He got close enough to see shapes against the dark glass. He knew what they were. There had to be two or three dozen corpses jammed up against the glass. And they were just the ones he could see. He wondered if it was airtight in there. The air could be toxic. It could actually kill him. He jogged back to the car.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Fuck!” said Eliot.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“Hang on one second,” Wil said. “I just want to ask this. Are we sure we want to open this box? Because what’s inside, you know, it killed a lot of people. We are talking about something incredibly dangerous. It’s striking me as kind of stupid to walk on in there and try to pick it up. That seems like a big risk. You know? You say I’m immune, but do you know that for sure? What if I just avoided it somehow the last time? I lay in a ditch and it passed over my head? I’m just saying, that emergency room, it’s wall-to-wall dead people, Eliot. It’s wall-to-wall. And there’s, I don’t know, something about a room full of corpses that makes me think about whether I want to go in there. Don’t look at me like that. I know. I know.” He shook his head. “I’ll go in. I will. It’s just . . . you’re asking me to maybe die, Eliot. Give me a second. Give me one . . . I know you’re hurting. I’m going. But appreciate what I’m doing. That’s all I want. I want you to acknowledge . . . for one second . . . the simple fact that I’m about to die. All right? I’m probably about to die. I’m happy to do it. I’m going. It’s fine. I only wanted . . .”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">He turned away. He walked. The glass was so dark. His feet scuffed. He reached the emergency room doors. His fingers touched the door plate. It was warm. Like there was a beating heart inside. It wasn’t that. It was just the sun. Everything here was warm. He looked back at the Valiant but couldn’t see it behind the paramedic van.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“If I don’t come out, Eliot,” he shouted, “fuck you!” His voice shook. He pushed open the door.</p>
