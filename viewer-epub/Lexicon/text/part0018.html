			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-First">Police say the student who was struck and killed by a vehicle on Montebury Avenue on Friday was attempting to cross the busy road away from lights or crossings.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The driver, a 39-year-old woman from Orange, was moving at or near the speed limit, police say.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text">The incident is likely to reignite calls for lights or a crossing, as it has been the scene of several accidents. The area was again targeted for upgrade in the Department of Transportation’s Pedestrian Safety Master Plan, but works were placed on hold last year due to local opposition.</p>
			<p class="x14-Newspaper-Text-Last">The student is believed to have been in his final year at an exclusive Williamsburg school. His name and details have not been released.</p>
