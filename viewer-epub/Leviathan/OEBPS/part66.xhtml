      <h2>â€œWell, someone tell McBride she doesnâ€™t need to shoot...</h2>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Alex said, his voice thoughtful. â€œIf we made those nukes stop listening, that means we canâ€™t shut â€™em down, right? Wonder whereâ€™em  [r w Fredâ€™s going to drop those.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHell if I know,â€� Amos said. â€œJust disarmed Earth, though. Thatâ€™s gotta be fucking embarrassing.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUnintended consequences,â€� Naomi sighed. â€œAlways with the unintended consequences.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Eros crashing into Venus was the most widely broadcast and recorded event in history. By the time the asteroid reached the sunâ€™s second planet, several hundred ships had taken up orbits there. Military vessels tried to keep the civilian ships away, but it was no use. They were just outnumbered. The video of Erosâ€™ descent was captured by military gun cameras, civilian ship telescopes, and the observatories on two planets and five moons.</p>
      <p>Holden wished he could have been there to see it up close, but Eros had picked up speed after it had turned, almost as though the asteroid were impatient for the journey to end now that the destination was in sight. He and the crew sat in the galley of the Rocinante and watched it on the broadcast newsfeeds. Amos had dug up yet another bottle of faux tequila from somewhere and was liberally splashing it into coffee cups. Alex had them flying toward Tycho at a gentle one-third g. No need to hurry now.</p>
      <p>It was all over but the fireworks.</p>
      <p>Holden reached out, took Naomiâ€™s hand, and held it tightly as the asteroid entered Venus orbit and then seemed to stop. He felt like he could feel the entire human race holding their breath. No one knew what Erosâ€”no, what Julieâ€”would do now. No one had spoken to Miller after the last time Holden had, and he wasnâ€™t answering his hand terminal. No one knew for sure what had happened on the asteroid.</p>
      <p>When the end came, it was beautiful.</p>
      <p>In orbit around Venus, Eros came apart like a puzzle box. The giant asteroid split into a dozen chunks, stringing out around the equator of the planet in a long necklace. Then those dozen pieces split into a dozen more, and then a dozen after that, a glittering fractal seed cloud spreading out across the entire surface of the planet, disappearing into the thick cloud layer that usually hid Venus from view.</p>
      <p>â€œWow,â€� Amos said, his voice almost reverent.</p>
      <p>â€œThat was gorgeous,â€� Naomi said. â€œVaguely unsettling, but gorgeous.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey wonâ€™t stay there forever,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Alex tossed off the last of the tequila in his glass, then refilled it from the bottle.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat dâ€™ya mean, Cap?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œWell, Iâ€™m just guessing. But I doubt the things that built the protomolecule just wanted to store it here. This was part of a bigger plan. We saved the Earth, Mars, the Belt. Question is, what happens now?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi and Alex exchanged glances. Amos pursed his lips. On-screen, Venus glittered as arcs of lightning danced all across the planet.</p>
      <p>â€œCap,â€� Amos said. â€œYou are seriously harshing my buzz.â€�</p>
      <p>Epilogue: Fred</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Frederick Lucius Johnson. Former colonel in Earthâ€™s armed forces, Butcher of Anderson Station. Thoth Statif Ande ^on now too. Unelected prime minister of the OPA. He had faced his own mortality a dozen times, lost friends to violence and politics and betrayal. Heâ€™d lived through four assassination attempts, only two of which were on any record. Heâ€™d killed a pistol-wielding attacker using only a table knife. Heâ€™d given the orders that had ended hundreds of lives, and stood by his decisions.</p>
      <p>And yet public speaking still made him nervous as hell. It didnâ€™t make sense, but there it was.</p>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroadsâ€”</p>
      <p>â€œGeneral Sebastian will be at the reception,â€� his personal secretary said. â€œRemember not to ask after her husband.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy? I didnâ€™t kill him, did I?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo, sir. Heâ€™s having a very public affair, and the generalâ€™s a bit touchy about it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSo she might want me to kill him.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou can make the offer, sir.â€�</p>
      <p>The â€œgreenroomâ€� was actually done in red and ochre, with a black leather couch, a mirrored wall, and a table laid out with hydroponic strawberries and carefully mineralized drinking water. The head of Ceres security, a dour-faced woman named Shaddid, had escorted him from the dock to the conference facilities three hours earlier. Since then, heâ€™d been pacingâ€”three steps in one direction, turn, three steps backâ€”like the captain of an ancient ship of the line on his quarterdeck.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the station, the representatives of the formerly warring factions were in rooms of their own, with secretaries of their own. Most of them hated Fred, which wasnâ€™t particularly a problem. Most of them feared him too. Not because of his standing in the OPA, of course. Because of the protomolecule.</p>
      <p>The political rift between Earth and Mars was probably irreparable; the Earth forces loyal to Protogen had engineered a betrayal too deep for apologies, and too many lives had been lost on both sides for the coming peace to look anything like it had been before. The naive among the OPA thought this was a good thing: an opportunity to play one planet against the other. Fred knew better. Unless all three forcesâ€”Earth, Mars, and the Beltâ€”could reach a real peace, they would inevitably fall back into a real war.</p>
      <p>Now if only Earth or Mars thought of the Belt as something more than an annoyance to be squashed after their true enemy was humiliatedâ€¦ But in truth, anti-Mars sentiment on Earth was higher now than it had been during the shooting war, and Martian elections were only four months away. A significant shift in the Martian polity could ease the tensions or make things immeasurably worse. Both sides had to see the big picture.</p>
      <p>Fred stopped before a mirror, adjusted his tunic for the hundredth time, and grimaced.</p>
      <p>â€œWhen did I turn into a damned marriage counselor?â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œWe arenâ€™t still talking about General Sebastian, are we, sir?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo. Forget I said anything. What else do I need to know?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s a possibility that Blue Mars will try to disrupt your presentation. Hecklers and signs, not guns. Captain Shaddid has several Blues in custody, but some may have slipped past her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAll right.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou have interviews scheduled with two political narrowcasts and a news source based on Europa. The Europa interviewen Euro cervr is likely to ask about Anderson Station.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAll right. Anything new from Venus?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSomethingâ€™s happening down there,â€� his secretary said.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s not dead, then.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œApparently not, sir.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGreat,â€� he said bitterly.</p>
      <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads. On one hand there is the very real threat of mutual annihilation, and on the otherâ€”</p>
      <p>And on the other, thereâ€™s the bogeyman of Venus, getting ready to crawl up out of its well and slaughter you all in your sleep. I have the live sample, which is your best, if not only, hope of divining what its intentions and capabilities are, and which I have hidden so that you canâ€™t just march over and take it from me. Itâ€™s the only reason any of you are listening to me in the first place. So how about a little respect here?</p>
      <p>His secretaryâ€™s terminal chirped, and she consulted it briefly.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s Captain Holden, sir.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDo I have to?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt would be best if he felt he was part of the effort, sir. He has a track record of amateur press releases.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFine. Bring him in.â€�</p>
      <p>The weeks that had passed since Eros Station had come apart in the thick skies of Venus had been good to Holden, but prolonged high-g dives like the one the Rocinante had sustained chasing Eros had long-lasting effects. The burst blood vessels in the manâ€™s sclera had healed; the pressure bruising was gone from around his eyes and the back of his neck. Only a little hesitation in the way he walked spoke of the deep joint pain, cartilage still on its way back to its natural form. Acceleration swagger, theyâ€™d called it, back when Fred had been a different man.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Holden said. â€œYouâ€™re looking pretty. Did you see the latest feed from Venus? Two-kilometer-high crystal towers. What do you think that is?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYour fault?â€� Fred suggested, keeping the tone friendly. â€œYou could have told Miller to drive it into the sun.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYes, because two-kilometer-high crystal towers coming out of the sun wouldnâ€™t be creepy at all,â€� Holden said. â€œAre those strawberries?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHave some,â€� Fred said. He hadnâ€™t been able to eat anything since that morning.</p>
      <p>â€œSo,â€� Holden said around a mouthful of fruit, â€œare they really going to sue me over this?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUnilaterally giving away all mineral and development rights to an entire planet on an open radio channel?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œI would guess the people who actually owned those rights are probably going to sue you,â€� Fred said. â€œIf they ever figure out who they are.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œCould you give me a hand with that?â€� Holden asked.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll be a character witness,â€� Fred said. â€œI donâ€™t actually make the law.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThen what exactly are you all doing here? Couldnâ€™t there be some kind of amnesty? We retrieved the protomolecule, tracked down Julie Mao on Eros, broke Protogen, and saved Earth.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou saved Earth?â€� ch?âp></p>
      <p>â€œWe helped,â€� Holden said, but his voice had a more somber tone. Millerâ€™s death still bothered the captain. Fred knew how that felt. â€œIt was a joint effort.â€�</p>
      <p>Fredâ€™s personal secretary cleared her throat and glanced toward the door. Theyâ€™d need to go soon.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll do what I can,â€� Fred said. â€œIâ€™ve got a lot of other things on the plate, but Iâ€™ll do what I can.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd Mars canâ€™t have the Roci back,â€� Holden said. â€œRight of salvage says thatâ€™s my ship now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThey arenâ€™t going to see it that way, but I will do what I can.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou keep saying that.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt keeps being all I can do.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd youâ€™ll tell them about him, right?â€� Holden said. â€œMiller. He deserves the credit.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Belter who went back into Eros of his own free will in order to save Earth? Youâ€™re damn right Iâ€™m going to tell them about him.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot â€˜the Belter.â€™ Him. Josephus Aloisus Miller.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden had stopped eating the free strawberries. Fred crossed his arms.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve been reading up,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œYeah. Well. I didnâ€™t know him all that well.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNeither did anybody else,â€� Fred said, and then softened a little. â€œI know itâ€™s hard, but we donâ€™t need a real man with a complex life. We need a symbol of the Belt. An icon.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSir,â€� the secretary said. â€œWe really do need to go now.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s what got us here,â€� Holden said. â€œIcons. Symbols. People without names. All of those Protogen scientists were thinking about biomass and populations. Not Mary who worked in supply and raised flowers in her spare time. None of them killed her.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou think they wouldnâ€™t have?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI think if they were going to, they owed it to her to know her name. All their names. And you owe it to Miller not to make him into something he wasnâ€™t.â€�</p>
