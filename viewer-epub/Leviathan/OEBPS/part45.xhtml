      <h2>â€œSo Mars finds out that maybe Earthâ€™s been building...</h2>
      <p>â€œOkay,â€� Holden said, waiting.</p>
      <p>â€œSo Mars calls,â€� Miller said. â€œI mean, I donâ€™t know for sure, but I bet thatâ€™s how it starts. A call from some bigwig on Mars to some bigwig on Earth.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œSeems reasonable,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat dâ€™you think Earth says back?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller reached over and flipped on one of the screens, then pulled up a file with his name on it, date stamped from less than an hour before. A recording of video from a Martian news source, showing the night sky through a Martian dome. Streaks and flashes fill the sky. The ticker across the bottom of the feed says that Earth ships in orbit around Mars suddenly and without warning fired on their Martian counterparts. The streaks in the sky are missiles. The flashes are ships dying.</p>
      <p>And then a massive white flare turns the Martian night into day for a few seconds, and the crawl says that the Deimos deep radar station has been destroyed.</p>
      <p>Holden sat and watched the video display the end of the solar system in vivid color and with expert commentary. He kept waiting for the streaks of light to begin descending on the planet itself, for the domes to fly apart in nuclear fire, but it seemed someone had kept some measure of restraint, and the battle remained in the sky.</p>
      <p>It couldnâ€™t stay that way forever.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re telling me that I did this,â€� Holden said.hat Icaln said. â€œThat if I hadnâ€™t broadcast that data, those ships would still be alive. Those people.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat, yeah. And that if the bad guys wanted to keep people from watching Eros, it just worked.â€�</p>
      <p>Chapter Thirty-Six: Miller</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The war stories flowed in. Miller watched the feeds five at a time, subscreens crowding the face of his terminal. Mars was shocked, amazed, reeling. The war between Mars and the Beltâ€”the biggest, most dangerous conflict in the history of mankindâ€”was suddenly a sideshow. The reactions of the talking heads of Earth security forces ran the gamut from calm, rational discussion of preemptive defense to foaming-at-the-mouth denunciations of Mars as a pack of baby-raping animals. The attack on Deimos had turned the moon into a slowly spreading ring of gravel in the moonâ€™s old orbit, a smudge on the Martian sky, and with that, the game had changed again.</p>
      <p>Miller watched for ten hours as the attack became the blockade. The Martian navy, spread throughout the system, was turning home under heavy burn. The OPA feeds were calling it a victory, and maybe someone thought that was true. The pictures came through from the ships, from the sensor arrays. Dead warships, their sides ripped open by high-energy explosions, spinning out into their irregular orbital graves. Medical bays like the Rociâ€™s filled with boys and girls half his age bleeding, burning, dying. Each cycle, new footage came in, new details of death and carnage. And each time some new clip appeared, he sat forward, hand on his mouth, waiting for the word to come. The one event that would signal the end of it all.</p>
      <p>But it hadnâ€™t come yet, and every hour that didnâ€™t bring it gave another sliver of hope that maybe, maybe it wasnâ€™t going to happen.</p>
      <p>â€œHey,â€� Amos said. â€œYou slept at all?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller looked up, his neck stiff. Red creases of his pillow still on his cheek and forehead, the mechanic stood in the open doorway of Millerâ€™s cabin.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat?â€� Miller said. Then: â€œYeah, no. Iâ€™ve beenâ€¦ watching.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnyone drop a rock?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot yet. Itâ€™s all still orbital or higher.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat kind of half-assed apocalypse are they running down there?â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œGive â€™em a break. Itâ€™s their first.â€�</p>
      <p>The mechanic shook his broad head, but Miller could see the relief under the feigned disgust. As long as the domes were still standing on Mars, as long as the critical biosphere of Earth wasnâ€™t in direct threat, humanity wasnâ€™t dead. Miller had to wonder what they were hoping for out in the Belt, whether theyâ€™d managed to talk themselves into believing that the rough ecological pockets of the asteroids would sustain life indefinitely.</p>
      <p>â€œYou want a beer?â€� Amos asked.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™re having beer for breakfast?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFigure itâ€™s dinner for you,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>The man was right. Miller needed sleep. He hadnâ€™t managed more than a catnap since theyâ€™d scuttled the stealth ship, and that had been plagued by strange dreams. He yawned at the thought of yawning, but the tension in his gut said he was more likely to spend the day watching newsfeeds than resting.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s probably breakfast again,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œWant some beer for breakfast?â€� Amos asked.</p>
      <p>â€œSure.â€�</p>
      <p>Walking through the Rocinante felt surreal. The quiet hum of the air recyclers, the softness of the air. The journey out to Julieâ€™s ship was a haze of pain medication and sickness. The time on Eros before that was a nightmare that wouldnâ€™t fade. To walk through the spare, functional corridors, thrust gravity holding him gently to the floor, with very little chance of anyone trying to kill him felt suspicious. When he imagined Julie walking with him, it wasnâ€™t so bad.</p>
      <p>As he ate, his terminal chimed, the automatic reminder for another blood flush. He stood, adjusted his hat, and headed off to let the needles and pressure injectors do their worst. The captain was already there and hooked into a station when Miller arrived.</p>
      <p>Holden looked like heâ€™d slept, but not well. There werenâ€™t the bruise-dark marks under his eyes that Miller had, but his shoulders were tense, his brow on the edge of furrowed. Miller wondered whether heâ€™d been a little too hard on the guy. I told you so could be an important message, but the burden of innocent death, of the chaos of a failing civilization might also be too much for one man to carry.</p>
      <p>Or maybe he was still mooning over Naomi.</p>
      <p>Holden raised the hand that wasnâ€™t encased in medical equipment.</p>
      <p>â€œMorning,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>â€œHey.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDecided where weâ€™re going yet?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot yet.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œGetting harder and harder to get to Mars,â€� Miller said, easing himself into the familiar embrace of the medical station. â€œIf thatâ€™s what youâ€™re aiming for, youâ€™d better do it soon.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhile thereâ€™s still a Mars, you mean?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFor instance,â€� Miller agreed.</p>
      <p>The needles snaked out on gently articulated armatures. Miller looked at the ceiling, trying not to tense up as the lines forced their way into his veins. There was a momentâ€™s stinging, then a low, dull ache, and then numbness. The display above him announced the state of his body to doctors who were watching young soldiers die miles above Olympus Mons.</p>
      <p>â€œDo you think theyâ€™d stop?â€� Holden asked. â€œI mean, Earth has got to be doing this because Protogen owns some generals or senators or something, right? Itâ€™s all because they want to be the only ones who have this thing. If Mars has it too, Protogen doesnâ€™t have a reason to fight.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller blinked. Before he could pick his answerâ€”Theyâ€™d try to annihilate Mars completely, or Itâ€™s gone too far for that, or Exactly how naive are you, Captain?â€”Holden went on.</p>
      <p>â€œScrew it. Weâ€™ve got the datafiles. Iâ€™m going to broadcast them.â€�</p>
      <p>Millerâ€™s reply was as easy as reflex.</p>
      <p>â€œNo, you arenâ€™t.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden propped himself up, storm clouds in his expression.</p>
      <p>â€œI appreciate that you might have a reasonable difference of opinion,â€� he said, â€œbut this is still my ship. Youâ€™re a passenger.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œTrue,â€� Miller said. â€œBut you have a hard timaid.  Chare shooting people, and you are going to have to shoot me before you send that thing out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m what?â€�</p>
      <p>The new blood flowed into Millerâ€™s system like a tickle of ice water crawling toward his heart. The medical monitors shifted to a new pattern, counting up the anomalous cells as they hit its filters.</p>
      <p>â€œYou are going to have to shoot me,â€� Miller said, slowly this time. â€œTwice now youâ€™ve had the choice of whether or not to break the solar system, and both times youâ€™ve screwed it up. I donâ€™t want to see you strike out.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI think you may have an exaggerated idea of how much influence the second-in-command of a long-distance water hauler actually has. Yes, thereâ€™s a war. And yes, I was there when it started up. But the Belt has hated the inner planets since a long time before the Cant was attacked.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ve got the inner planets divided up too,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Holden tilted his head.</p>
      <p>â€œEarth has always hated Mars,â€� Holden said like he was reporting that water was wet. â€œWhen I was in the navy, we ran projections for this. Battle plans if Earth and Mars ever really got into it. Earth loses. Unless they hit first, hit hard, and donâ€™t let up, Earth just plain loses.â€�</p>
      <p>Maybe it was distance. Maybe it was a failure of imagination. Miller had never seen the inner planets as divided.</p>
      <p>â€œSeriously?â€� he asked.</p>
      <p>â€œTheyâ€™re the colony, but they have all the best toys and everyone knows it,â€� Holden said. â€œEverything thatâ€™s happening out there right now has been building up for a hundred years. If it hadnâ€™t been there to start with, this couldnâ€™t have happened.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s your defense? â€˜Not my powder keg; I just brought the matchâ€™?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m not making a defense,â€� Holden said. His blood pressure and heart rate were spiking.</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™ve been through this,â€� Miller said. â€œSo let me just ask, why is it you think this time will be different?â€�</p>
      <p>The needles in Millerâ€™s arm seemed to heat up almost to the point of being painful. He wondered if that was normal, if every blood flush he had was going to feel the same way.</p>
      <p>â€œThis time is different,â€� Holden said. â€œAll the crap thatâ€™s going on out there is what happens when you have imperfect information. Mars and the Belt wouldnâ€™t have been going after each other in the first place if theyâ€™d known what we know now. Earth and Mars wouldnâ€™t be shooting each other if everyone knew the fight was being engineered. The problem isnâ€™t that people know too much, itâ€™s that they donâ€™t know enough.â€�</p>
      <p>Something hissed and Miller felt a wave of chemical relaxation swim through him. He resented it, but there was no calling the drugs back.</p>
      <p>â€œYou canâ€™t just throw information at people,â€� Miller said. â€œYou have to know what it means. What itâ€™s going to do. There was a case back on Ceres. Little girl got killed. For the first eighteen hours, we were all sure Daddy did it. He was a felon. A drunk. He was the last one who saw her breathing. All the classic signs. Hour nineteen, we get a tip. Turned out Daddy owed a lot of money to one of the local syndicates. All of a sudden, things are more complicated. We have more suspects. Do you think if Iâ€™d been broadcasting everything I knew, Daddy would still have I kn Cill been alive when the tip came? Or would someone have put it all together and done the obvious thing?â€�</p>
      <p>Millerâ€™s medical station chimed. Another new cancer. He ignored it. Holdenâ€™s cycle was just finishing, the redness of his cheeks speaking as much to the fresh, healthy blood in his body as to his emotional state.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s the same ethos they have,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œWho?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œProtogen. You may be on different sides, but youâ€™re playing the same game. If everyone said what they knew, none of this would have happened. If the first lab tech on Phoebe who saw something weird had gotten on his system and said, â€˜Hey, everyone! Look, this is weird,â€™ none of this would have happened.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah,â€� Miller said, â€œbecause telling everyone thereâ€™s an alien virus that wants to kill them all is a great way to maintain calm and order.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMiller,â€� Holden said. â€œI donâ€™t mean to panic you, but thereâ€™s an alien virus. And it wants to kill everyone.â€�</p>
      <p>Miller shook his head and smiled like Holden had said something funny. â€œSo look, maybe I canâ€™t point a gun at you and make you do the right thing. But lemme ask you something. Okay?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œFine,â€� Holden said. Miller leaned back. The drugs were making his eyelids heavy.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat happens?â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>There was a long pause. Another chime from the medical system. Another rush of cold through Millerâ€™s abused veins.</p>
      <p>â€œWhat happens?â€� Holden repeated. It occurred to Miller he could have been more specific. He forced his eyes open again.</p>
      <p>â€œYou broadcast everything weâ€™ve got. What happens?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe war stops. People go after Protogen.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s some holes in that, but let it go. What happens after that?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden was quiet for a few heartbeats.</p>
      <p>â€œPeople start going after the Phoebe bug,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œThey start experimenting. They start fighting for it. If that little bastardâ€™s as valuable as Protogen thinks, you canâ€™t stop the war. All you can do now is change it.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden frowned, angry lines at the corners of his mouth and eyes. Miller watched a little piece of the manâ€™s idealism die and was sorry that it gave him joy.</p>
      <p>â€œSo what happens if we get to Mars?â€� Miller went on, his voice low. â€œWe trade out the protomolecule for more money than any of us have ever seen. Or maybe they just shoot you. Mars just wins against Earth. And the Belt. Or you go to the OPA, who are the best hope the Belt has of independence, and theyâ€™re a bunch of crazy zealots, half of â€™em thinking we can actually sustain out there without Earth. And trust me, theyâ€™ll probably shoot you too. Or you just tell everyone everything and pretend that however it comes down, you kept your hands clean.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThereâ€™s a right thing to do,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t have a right thing, friend,â€� Miller said. â€œYouâ€™ve got a whole plateful of maybe a little less wrong.â€�</p>
      <p>Holdenâ€™s blood flush finished. The captain pulled the needles out of his arm and let the thin metallic tentacles retract. As he rolled down his sleeve, the frown softened.</p>
      <p>â€œPeople have a right to know whatâ€™s going on,â€� Holden said. â€œYour argument boils down to you not thinking people are smart enough to figure out the right way to use it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œHas anyone used anything youâ€™ve broadcast as something besides an excuse to shoot someone they already didnâ€™t like? Giving them a new reason wonâ€™t stop them killing each other,â€� Miller said. â€œYou started these wars, Captain. Doesnâ€™t mean you can stop them. But you have to try.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAnd how am I supposed to do that?â€� Holden said. The distress in his voice could have been anger. It could have been prayer.</p>
      <p>Something in Millerâ€™s belly shifted, some inflamed organ calming enough to slip back into place. He hadnâ€™t been aware heâ€™d felt wrong until he suddenly felt right again.</p>
      <p>â€œYou ask yourself what happens,â€� Miller said. â€œAsk yourself what Naomiâ€™d do.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden barked out a laugh. â€œIs that how you make your decisions?â€�</p>
      <p>Miller let his eyes close. Juliette Mao was there, sitting on the couch at her old apartment on Ceres. Fighting the crew of the stealth ship to a standstill. Burst open by the alien virus on the floor of her shower stall.</p>
      <p>â€œSomething like it,â€� Miller said.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>The report from Ceres, a break from the usual competing press releases, came that night. The governing council of the OPA announced that a ring of Martian spies had been rooted out. The video feed showed the bodies floating out an industrial airlock in what looked like the old docks in sector six. At a distance, the victims seemed almost peaceful. The feed cut to the head of security. Captain Shaddid looked older. Harder.</p>
      <p>â€œWe regret the necessity of this action,â€� she said to everyone everywhere. â€œBut in the cause of freedom, there can be no compromise.â€�</p>
