      <h2>â€œHey, partner,â€� Havelock said. â€œThat favor you...</h2>
      <p>Eros.</p>
      <p>Great.</p>
      <p>Miller nodded at the woman behind him, stepped out of line, and walked to the kiosk. By the time a screen was open, they were calling final boarding for the Tycho transport. Miller turned in his ticket, got a nominal refund, and spent a third of what he still had in his account for a ticket to Eros. Still, it could have been worse. He could have been on the way before he got word. He had to start thinking about it as good luck, not bad.</p>
      <p>The passage confirmation came through with a chime like a gently struck triangle.</p>
      <p>â€œI hope Iâ€™m right about this,â€� he said to Julie. â€œIf Holdenâ€™s not there, Iâ€™m gonna feel pretty stupid.â€�</p>
      <p>In his mind, she smiled ruefully.</p>
      <p>Life is risk, she said.</p>
      <p>Chapter Twenty-One: Holden</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Ships were small. Space was always at a premium, and even on a monster like the Donnager, the corridors and compartments were cramped and uncomfortable. On the Rocinante, the only rooms where Holden could spread out his arms withocoulne …ut touching two walls were the galley and the cargo bay. No one who flew for a living was claustrophobic, but even the most hardened Belt prospector could recognize the rising tension of being ship-bound. It was the ancient stress response of the trapped animal, the subconscious knowledge that there was literally nowhere to go that you couldnâ€™t see from where you were already standing. Getting off the ship at port was a sudden and sometimes giddying release of tension.</p>
      <p>It often took the form of a drinking game.</p>
      <p>Like all professional sailors, Holden had sometimes ended long flights by drinking himself into a stupor. More than once heâ€™d wandered into a brothel and left only when they threw him out with an emptied account, a sore groin, and a prostate as dry as the Sahara desert. So when Amos staggered into his room after three days on station, Holden knew exactly what the big mechanic felt like.</p>
      <p>Holden and Alex were sharing the couch and watching a newsfeed. Two talking heads were discussing the Belter actions with words like criminal, terrorist, and sabotage. The Martians were â€œpeacekeepers.â€� It was a Martian news channel. Amos snorted and collapsed on the couch. Holden muted the screen.</p>
      <p>â€œHaving a good shore leave, sailor?â€� Holden asked with a grin.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll never drink again,â€� Amos groaned.</p>
      <p>â€œNaomiâ€™s cominâ€™ over with some chow she got at that sushi place,â€� Alex said. â€œNice raw fish wrapped in fake seaweed.â€�</p>
      <p>Amos groaned again.</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s not nice, Alex,â€� Holden said. â€œLet the manâ€™s liver die in peace.â€�</p>
      <p>The door to the suite slid open again, and Naomi came in carrying a tall stack of white boxes.</p>
      <p>â€œFoodâ€™s here,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>Alex opened all the boxes and started handing around small disposable plates.</p>
      <p>â€œEvery time itâ€™s your turn to get food, you get salmon rolls. It shows a lack of imagination,â€� Holden said as he began putting food on his plate.</p>
      <p>â€œI like salmon,â€� Naomi replied.</p>
      <p>The room got quiet as people ate; the only sounds were the clack of plastic chopsticks and the wet squish of things being dipped in wasabi and soy. When the food was gone, Holden wiped his eyes, made runny by the heat in his sinuses, and leaned his chair all the way back. Amos used one of his chopsticks to scratch under the cast on his leg.</p>
      <p>â€œYou guys did a pretty good job setting this,â€� he said. â€œItâ€™s the thing on my body that hurts the least right now.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi grabbed the remote off Holdenâ€™s armrest and turned the volume back on. She began spooling through the different feeds. Alex closed his eyes and slid down on the loveseat, lacing his fingers across his belly and sighing contentedly. Holden felt a sudden and irrational annoyance at his crew for being so comfortable.</p>
      <p>â€œEveryone had enough of sucking on Fredâ€™s teat yet?â€� he said. â€œI know I have.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat the fuck are you talking about?â€� Amos said, shaking his head. â€œIâ€™m just getting started.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI mean,â€� Holden said, â€œhow long are we going to hang around on Tycho, drinking and whoring and eating sushi on Fredâ€™s expense account?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œAs long as I can?â€� Alex said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou have a better plan, then,â€� Naomi said.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t have a plan, but I want to get back in the game. We were full of righteous anger and dreams of vengeance when we got here, and a couple of blowjobs and hangovers later, itâ€™s like nothing ever happened.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œUh, vengeance kinda requires someone to avenge upon, Cap,â€� Alex said. â€œCase you ainâ€™t noticed, weâ€™re lackinâ€™ in that department.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThat ship is still out there, somewhere. The people who ordered it to shoot are, too,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œSo,â€� Alex replied slowly, â€œwe take off and start flyinâ€™ in a spiral until we run into it?â€�</p>
      <p>Naomi laughed and threw a soy packet at him.</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t know what we do,â€� Holden said, â€œbut sitting here while the people who killed our ship keep doing whatever it is theyâ€™re doing is making me nuts.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWeâ€™ve been here three days,â€� Naomi said. â€œWe deserve some comfortable beds and decent food and a chance to blow off steam. Donâ€™t try to make us feel bad for taking it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œBesides, Fred said weâ€™ll get those bastards at the trial,â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œIf thereâ€™s a trial,â€� Holden replied. â€œIf. It wonâ€™t happen for months, or maybe even years. And even then, Fredâ€™s looking at those treaties. Amnesty might be another bargaining chip, right?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou were quick enough to agree to his terms, Jim,â€� Naomi said. â€œChanged your mind?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIf Fred wants depositions in exchange for letting us patch up and rest, the price was cheap. That doesnâ€™t mean I think a trial will fix everything, or that I want to be sidelined until it happens.â€�</p>
      <p>He gestured at the faux-leather couch and huge wall screen around them.</p>
      <p>â€œBesides, this can be a prison. Itâ€™s a nice one, but as long as Fred controls the purse strings, he owns us. Make no mistake.â€�</p>
      <p>Naomiâ€™s brow crinkled; her eyes grew serious.</p>
      <p>â€œWhatâ€™s the option, sir?â€� she asked. â€œLeave?â€�</p>
      <p>Holden folded his arms, his mind turning over everything heâ€™d said as if he was hearing it for the first time. Saying things out loud actually made them clearer.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m thinking we look for work,â€� he said. â€œWeâ€™ve got a good ship. More importantly, we have a sneaky ship. Itâ€™s fast. We can run without a transponder if we need to. Lots of people will need things moved from place to place with a war on. Gives us something to do while we wait for Fredâ€™s trial, and a way to put money in our pockets so we can get off the dole. And, as we fly from place to place, we can keep our ears and eyes open. Never know what weâ€™ll find. And seriously, how long can you three stand to be station rats?â€�</p>
      <p>There was a momentâ€™s silence.</p>
      <p>â€œI could station rat for anotherâ€¦ week?â€� Amos said.</p>
      <p>â€œIt ainâ€™t a bad idea, Cap,â€� Alex said with a nod.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s your decision, Captain,â€� Naomi said. â€œIâ€™ll stick with you, and I like the idea of getting my own money again. But I hope youâ€™re not in a hurry. I could really use a few more days off.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden clapped his hands and jumped to his feet.s ha Chis</p>
      <p>â€œNope,â€� he said. â€œHaving a plan makes all the difference. Downtimeâ€™s easier to enjoy when I know itâ€™ll end.â€�</p>
      <p>Alex and Amos got up together and headed for the door. Alex had won a few dollars playing darts, and now he and Amos were in the process of turning it into even more money at the card tables.</p>
      <p>â€œDonâ€™t wait up, Boss,â€� Amos said to Naomi. â€œIâ€™m feeling lucky today.â€�</p>
      <p>They left, and Holden went to the small kitchen nook to make coffee. Naomi followed him in.</p>
      <p>â€œOne other thing,â€� she said.</p>
      <p>Holden tore open the sealed coffee packet, the strong odor filling the room.</p>
      <p>â€œShoot,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œFred is taking care of all the arrangements for Kellyâ€™s body. Heâ€™ll hold it here in state until we go public with our survival. Then heâ€™ll ship it back to Mars.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden filled the coffeemaker with water from the tap and started the machine. It made soft gurgling sounds.</p>
      <p>â€œGood. Lieutenant Kelly deserves all the respect and dignity we can give him.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œIt got me thinking about that data cube he had. I havenâ€™t been able to hack it. Itâ€™s some kind of military Ã¼ber-encryption that makes my head hurt. Soâ€¦ â€�</p>
      <p>â€œJust say it,â€� Holden said with a frown.</p>
      <p>â€œI want to give it to Fred. I know itâ€™s a risk. We have no idea whatâ€™s on it, and for all his charm and hospitality, Fredâ€™s still OPA. But he was also high-ranking UN military. And heâ€™s got a serious brain trust here on the station. He might be able to open it up.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden thought for a moment, then nodded.</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, let me sit with that. I want to know what Yao was trying to get off the ship, butâ€”â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah.â€�</p>
      <p>They shared a companionable silence as the coffee brewed. When it was finished, Holden poured two mugs and handed one to Naomi.</p>
      <p>â€œCaptain,â€� she said, then paused. â€œJim. Iâ€™ve been a pain-in-the-ass XO so far. Iâ€™ve been stressed out and scared shitless about eighty percent of the time.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou do an amazing job of hiding that fact,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>Naomi nodded the compliment away.</p>
      <p>â€œAnyway, Iâ€™ve been pushy about some things that I probably shouldnâ€™t have been.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot a big deal.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œOkay, let me finish,â€� she said. â€œI want you to know I think youâ€™ve done a great job of keeping us alive. You keep us focused on the problems we can solve instead of feeling sorry for ourselves. You keep everyone in orbit around you. Not everyone can do that, I couldnâ€™t do it, and weâ€™ve needed that stability.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden felt a glow of pride. He hadnâ€™t expected it, and he didnâ€™t trust it, but it felt good all the same.</p>
      <p>â€œThank you,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>â€œI canâ€™t speak for Amos and Alex, but I plan to stick it out. Youâ€™re not just the captain because McDowell is dead. Youâ€™re our captain, as far as Iâ€™m concerned. Just so you know.â€�</p>
      <p>She looked down, blushing as ">Sh Cshiif sheâ€™d just confessed something. Maybe she had.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ll try not to blow it,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™d appreciate that, sir.â€�</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Fred Johnsonâ€™s office was like its occupant: big, intimidating, and overflowing with things that needed to be done. The room was easily two and a half square meteres, making it larger than any single compartment on the Rocinante. His desk was made of actual wood, looked at least a hundred years old, and smelled of lemon oil. Holden sat in a chair that was just a little lower than Fredâ€™s, and looked at the mounds of file folders and papers covering every flat surface.</p>
      <p>Fred had sent for him and then spent the first ten minutes after heâ€™d arrived speaking on the phone. Whatever he was talking about, it sounded technical. Holden assumed it was related to the giant generation ship outside. It didnâ€™t bother him to be ignored for a few minutes, since the wall behind Fred was entirely covered by a bleedingly high-definition screen pretending to be a window. It was showing a spectacular view of the Nauvoo moving past as the station spun. Fred spoiled the scene by putting the phone down.</p>
      <p>â€œSorry about that,â€� he said. â€œThe atmosphere processing system has been a nightmare from day one. When youâ€™re going a hundred plus years on only the air you can bring with you, the loss tolerances areâ€¦ stricter than usual. Sometimes itâ€™s difficult to impress the importance of fine details on the contractors.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI was enjoying the view,â€� Holden said, gesturing at the screen.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™m starting to wonder if weâ€™ll be able to get it done on schedule.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhy?â€�</p>
      <p>Fred sighed and leaned his chair back with a squeak.</p>
      <p>â€œItâ€™s the war between Mars and the Belt.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œMaterial shortages, then?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNot just that. Pirate casts claiming to speak for the OPA are working into a frenzy. Belt prospectors with homemade torpedo launchers are firing on Martian warships. They get wiped out in response, but every now and then one of those torpedoes hits and kills a few Martians.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhich means Mars starts shooting first.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred nodded and then got up and started pacing the room.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd then even honest citizens on legitimate business start getting worried about going out of the house,â€� he said. â€œWeâ€™ve had over a dozen late shipments so far this month, and Iâ€™m worried it will stop being delays and start being cancellations.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou know, Iâ€™ve been thinking about the same thing,â€� Holden said.</p>
      <p>Fred acted as though he hadnâ€™t heard.</p>
      <p>â€œIâ€™ve been on that bridge,â€� Fred said. â€œUnidentified ship coming on you, and a decision to make? No one wants to press the button. Iâ€™ve watched a ship get bigger and bigger on the scope while my finger was on the trigger. I remember begging them to stop.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden said nothing. Heâ€™d seen it too. There was nothing to say. Fred let silence hang in the air for a moment, then shook his head and straightened up.</p>
      <p>â€œI need to ask you a favor,â€� Fred said.</p>
      <p>â€œYou can always ask, Fred. Youâ€™ve paid for that much,â€� Holden replied.</p>
      <p>â€œI need to borrow your ship.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Roci?â€� Holden said. â€œWhy?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI need to have something picked up and delivered here, and I need a ship that can stay quiet and run past Martian picket ships if it needs to.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThe Rocinante is definitely the right ship, then, but that didnâ€™t answer my question. Why?â€�</p>
      <p>Fred turned his back to Holden and looked at the view screen. The nose of the Nauvoo was just vanishing from sight. The view turned to the flat, star-speckled black of forever.</p>
      <p>â€œI need to pick someone up on Eros,â€� he said. â€œSomeone important. Iâ€™ve got people who can do it, but the only ships weâ€™ve got are light freighters and a couple of small shuttles. Nothing that can make the trip quickly enough or have a hope of running away if trouble starts.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œDoes this person have a name? I mean, you keep saying you donâ€™t want to fight, but the other unique thing about my ship is that itâ€™s the only one here with guns. Iâ€™m sure the OPA has a whole list of things theyâ€™d like blown up.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t trust me.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNope.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred turned back around and gripped the back of his chair. His knuckles were white. Holden wondered if heâ€™d gone too far.</p>
      <p>â€œLook,â€� Holden said, â€œyou talk a good game about peace and trials and all that. You disavow the pirate casts. You have a nice station filled with nice people. I have every reason to believe you are what you say you are. But weâ€™ve been here three days, and the first time you tell me about your plans, you ask to borrow my ship for a secret mission. Sorry. If Iâ€™m part of this, I get full access; no secrets. Even if I knew for a fact, which I donâ€™t, that you had nothing but good intentions, I still wouldnâ€™t go along with the cloak-and-dagger bullshit.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred stared at him for a few seconds, then came around his chair and sat down. Holden found he was tapping his fingers on his thigh nervously and forced himself to stop. Fredâ€™s eyes flicked down at Holdenâ€™s hand and then back up. He continued to stare.</p>
      <p>Holden cleared his throat.</p>
      <p>â€œLook, youâ€™re the big dog here. Even if I didnâ€™t know who you used to be, youâ€™d scare the shit out of me, so donâ€™t feel the need to prove it. But no matter how scared I am, Iâ€™m not backing down on this.â€�</p>
      <p>Fredâ€™s hoped-for laughter didnâ€™t come. Holden tried to swallow without gulping.</p>
      <p>â€œI bet every captain you ever flew under thought you were a gigantic pain in the ass,â€� Fred said finally.</p>
      <p>â€œI believe my record reflects that,â€� Holden said, trying to hide his relief.</p>
      <p>â€œI need to fly to Eros and find a man named Lionel Polanski, and then bring him back to Tycho.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œThatâ€™s only a week out if we push,â€� Holden said, doing the math in his head.</p>
      <p>â€œThe fact that Lionel doesnâ€™t actually exist complicates the mission.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYeah, okay. Now Iâ€™m confused,â€� Holden agreed.</p>
      <p>â€œYou wanted in?â€� Fred said, the words taking on a quiet ferocity.rds  Cfer â€œNow youâ€™re in. Lionel Polanski exists only on paper, and owns things that Mr. Tycho doesnâ€™t want to own. Including a courier ship called the Scopuli.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden leaned forward in his chair, his face intense.</p>
      <p>â€œYou now have my undivided attention,â€� he said.</p>
      <p>â€œThe nonexistent owner of the Scopuli checked into a flophouse on one of the shit levels of Eros. We only just got the message. We have to work on the assumption that whoever got the room knows our operations intimately, needs help, and canâ€™t ask for it openly.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWe can leave in an hour,â€� Holden said breathlessly.</p>
      <p>Fred held up his hands in a gesture that was surprisingly Belter for an Earth man.</p>
      <p>â€œWhen,â€� Fred asked, â€œdid this turn into you leaving?â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI wonâ€™t loan my ship, but Iâ€™ll definitely rent it out. My crew and I were talking about getting jobs, actually. Hire us. Deduct whateverâ€™s fair for services youâ€™ve already rendered.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Fred said. â€œI need you.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYou donâ€™t,â€� Holden replied. â€œYou need our depositions. And weâ€™re not going to sit here waiting a year or two for sanity to reign. Weâ€™ll all do video depositions, sign whatever affidavits you want us to as to their authenticity, but weâ€™re leaving to find work one way or the other. You might as well make use of it.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œNo,â€� Fred said. â€œYouâ€™re too valuable to take risks with your lives.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œWhat if I throw in the data cube the captain of the Donnager was trying to liberate?â€�</p>
      <p>The silence was back, but it had a different feel to it.</p>
      <p>â€œLook,â€� Holden said, pressing on. â€œYou need a ship like the Roci. Iâ€™ve got one. You need a crew for her. Iâ€™ve got that too. And youâ€™re as hungry to know whatâ€™s on that cube as I am.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œI donâ€™t like the risk.â€�</p>
      <p>â€œYour other option is to throw us in the brig and commandeer the ship. Thereâ€™s some risks in that too.â€�</p>
      <p>Fred laughed. Holden felt himself relax.</p>
      <p>â€œYouâ€™ll still have the same problem that brought you here,â€� Fred said. â€œYour ship looks like a gunship, no matter what its transponder is saying.â€�</p>
      <p>Holden jumped up and grabbed a piece of paper from Fredâ€™s desk. He started writing on it with a pen snatched from a decorative pen set.</p>
